Thanks for considering contributing to this project.

Here are several levels of contribution that you can make, depending on your
time and skill levels.

We will lay the types of tasks out in an increasing demand on the skill 
level of coding and or time needed. 

# non-coding related contributions:
We love these contributions since as coders sometimes we forget how to put in
good content.

- [ ] report aesthetic bugs / typos / grammatical mistakes / deadlinks through the issues tab 
- [ ] adding content: such as entire pages about their projects / themselves / tutorials but with minimal aesthetic additions, these can be written in markdown for simplicity. You can send the markdown along with any images / videos to us. 
- [ ] taking more pictures of the DSI / DSI events, preferably with wide screen ratio for banners


# web dev / coding related contributions:
For this category of contribution, please read through and go through the setup
in the `README.md` page.
We expect you to inform yourself of the frameworks
that we have put in place so you do not invent the existing `CSS` / `html` styles and 
javascripts that we have already installed. 

Please contribute your code in the form of a pull request, after compiling and examining
that the output site in the development view is not broken. 

## Design principle
For this new site, we have used the `Bootstrap` `Flatly` `CSS` sheets along with  `Pelican` templates 
to set the main design of our site.  

Most of the main content are copied from the old site, and
we are trying to make use of those `CSS` styles for styling html elements 
and tweak elements across the `CSS` instead of tweaking individual html elements.

### References for Bootstrap 
See [Bootstrap components page](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#labels) and 
[W3schools Bootstrap tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp) to see the styles for the 
the different CSS styles for the html elements that are available to you.

The tasks in these category are mostly self-described in the `GitHub` issues page.

## Advanced and ongoing tasks
There are ongoing, more advanced tasks that we want to achieve:
- [ ] set up unit tests to test for broken links / images  
- [ ] set up continuous integration  
- [ ] identify html pages / articles of a certain type, set up and improve the styles of the templates  
- [ ] code up programmatic solutions to make it easier to post announcements
		on this site, on the mailing list, and / or on a google calendar 
- [ ] code up a bot that has strong AI for doing everything for us ;)
