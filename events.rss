What do you do to promote software citation in your scientific community? <br/>
We invite you to come together with other investigators on campus spanning the rich diversity of campus research in addressing this question. The goal of this brown box lunch is to create a campus community of and start a conversation amongst research software developers to share practices and needs in the area of software citation.  The luncheon will open with a lightening round of introductions from all participants which we hope will invigorate both large and small group discussion over an informal lunch.

Graduate Student Summer Research Opportunity
<p>
A graduate student researcher is being sought for 2 to 2.5 months during summer 2015 to work on a project titled, "Music-evoked remembering in the age of Big Data." The project is being supervised by Dr. Petr Janata (Psychology) in association with Drs. Duncan Temple Lang (Statistics), Raul Aranovich (Linguistics), and Arne Ekstrom (Psychology). 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/research/music-evoked-remembering-in-the-age-of-big-data">Project Description</a>
</p>

<p>
The project combines psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, statistics, and computer science.  We are seeking a student who can contribute to the technical core of the project, which has social media, semantic web, and neuroimaging components. The successful candidate will have skills that cover some number of the following programming and query languages, protocols, and toolkits: Python, JavaScript,  R, MATLAB, RDF/RDFS/OWL, SPARQL, Prolog, nltk, TXM, and d3.  Experience working in the Amazon Web Services environment is desirable but not required.  Excellent programming and documentation practices are mandatory.
</p>
<p>
To apply, please submit a letter of interest to pjanata@ucdavis.edu that states why you are interested in this project and how it interfaces with your current or future research interests.  Enumerate your relevant skills.  Indicate your availability between the end of Spring Quarter 2015 and the start of Fall Quarter 2015.
</p>
<p>
All applications received by the end of the day, Friday, May 1, 2015, will be considered.
