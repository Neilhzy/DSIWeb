<center><h2>Affiliate Activities</h2></center>

<p>
We expect all of the affiliates to be actively engaged in some aspects of the DSI.
You'll get to learn and share new things, get ideas for your research, develop new projects, find new information, and network among yourselves and
others.  This interdisciplinary interaction is so valuable, rare and requires taking the time to participate.

<p>
We welcome suggestions for other ways that affiliates can be active. Send an email
to datascience@ucdavis.edu or talk with Duncan, Pamela or Carl.

<dl>
<dt>1) Attend (and present) at our Problem Solving un-Seminars
<dd>You don't have to know anything about that week's topic to
contribute and learn from these unique 'flipped' design talks. We expect all affiliates to present a problem solving
un-seminar during their tenure in our program. Contact us if you have a topic in mind and we'll discuss and get you on
the schedule. Also, we appreciate your help in identifying individuals across the university who would also be good
candidates as speakers for this series.

<dt> 2.  Participate in our workshops
<dd> Come learn a new skill or, if you are already proficient in that topic, come as a
guest TA. Have expertise in an area and want to give a workshop? Have suggestions for future workshops? Let us know!

<dt>3.  Hold group office hours at the DSI
<dd> Get together with other affiliates who have complementary technical skills and
strengths and pick a consistent time to be available throughout the quarter to field questions from the research
community on campus. This is great experience if you are considering a career in industry and/or consulting, looks good
on your CV, and is good practice for you to apply the skills you have learned to a variety of projects. Pamela can
reserve the DSI space for you and publicize your hours.

<dt>4.  Organize or participate in a reading group
<dd>These can be a short format (a few weeks) or a longer (quarter or year
long) self-taught investigation into any topic within the broad purview of data science. To gauge interest and form a
group on a topic, send an email out to your peers on the <b>disaffiliates@ucdavis.edu</b>
listserv describing the topic. Once you have a group together let us know when you want to meet and we'll get you the
space.

<dt>5. Lead or participate in an affiliates project
<dd>If you have an interesting research question or side project, form a
working group with your colleagues here at the DSI. The project can relate to your individual research, a competition or
just something you find interesting and want to investigate - it's up to you to decide what you want to do. We already
have a few successful examples of these projects ongoing at the DSI and want to foster more. Not sure how to set up and
manage a research team? Pamela can help you get started.

<dt>6.  Mentor data science undergrads
<dd> We have a few undergrad interns here at the DSI and a new data science club is
forming on campus. Contact Pamela if you're interested in becoming a mentor for individual students and/or the
club. This is a minimal-time investment activity that can have a big impact on the lives of our students.

<dt>7.  "Be" in the DSI space
<dd>We want you to come to the DSI, to spend some time working in our space and interacting with
your peers from across the university. If you are interested in having a designated workspace in the DSI let us know. In
return we promise to always have coffee (although sometimes you will have to make it!), to sometimes have cookies, and
to always be willing to chat with you about your data science questions and needs.

<dt>8.  Help with admin activities for the DSI
<dd>Let Pamela know if you want to help with our events and/or be a subject
matter liaison. This includes ongoing activities as well as planning and seeking out new opportunities for the DSI to
engage in meaningful ways with campus and the broader community.

</dl>

In addition to the title of being a formal member of the DSI, affiliates have access to our resources (space, computers,
community, etc.) and will be eligible to apply for future travel grants, GSR positions, and other opportunities through
the DSI.
