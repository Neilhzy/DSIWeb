location:  UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento
role: Director of Informatics Research for UC Davis School of Medicine and Robert D. Cardiff Professor of Informatics, and Associate Director for Health at the UC Davis Data Science Initiative.
title:
desc:  Professor Anderson leads the development of the research informatics capabilities across the health system. His primary focus is on access to clinical data for research and secondary use, data policy and data sharing, and sustainable informatics infrastructure development. His research examines deidentified large-scale clinical data sharing including the processes, technologies and ethical impact of biomedicine data sharing for the advancement of “translational” science.

location:
role: Professor of Computer Science and Founding Director of the Data Science Initiative.
title:
desc: Professor Koehl’s interests lay at the interface of physics, geometry and biology. His research focuses on computational algorithmic developments and management of complex biological data as well as the quantification of biological systems (morphometry) and the formation (morphogenesis) and evolution (morphodynamics) of of molecular shapes. His research group develops new statistical algorithms for clustering post-genomic data, and geometric methods for processing image data for high-throughput comparisons of 3D-images.

* _[Colin Cameron](http://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/)_, Professor of Economics. Professor Cameron’s research speciality is economic theory and microeconmetrics for cross-section data, especially count data, with applications to labor and health economic data. 

* _[Paul Dodd](http://research.ucdavis.edu/about-us/or-leadership/#avcirsi)_, Associate Vice Chancellor for Interdisciplinary Research and Strategic Initiatives. Dr. Dodd’s background is in nanoscale materials science and applied physics, and has worked at the interface of industry, academia for over 20 years. He administers the ten UC Davis Organized Research Units and is responsible for developing interdisciplinary research activities for the Davis campus including initiating, supporting and coordinating the development of new strategic research partnerships. You can read more about his background and the UC Davis interdisciplinary research and strategic initiatives, [here](http://research.ucdavis.edu/about-us/or-leadership/#avcirsi).

* _[Viji Murali](https://iet.ucdavis.edu/cio)_, Chief Information Office and Vice Provost of Information and Educational Technology (IET) at UC Davis. Murali oversees IET and leads the development of a coordinated IT technology strategy across the university, including the Davis and Sacramento (Health System) campuses. With nearly three decades of experience in the field of information technology, Murali has led major initiatives in research, high-performance, instructional, administrative efficiency, and enterprise computing, as well as telecommunications. As a member of the UC Davis Health System IT Oversight Committee and the University of California IT Leadership Council, she works in partnership with the system-wide leadership to articulate goals and seek opportunities to address common IT challenges. She has a background in chemistry and a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Arizona, Tucson.
* _[Tony Tyson](http://tyson.ucdavis.edu/)_, Distinguished Professor of Physics. Professor Tyson is an experimental physicist with research in cosmology including dark matter distribution, gravitational lens effects, cosmic shear, the nature of dark energy, and instrumentation for optical astronomy. He pioneered the field of weak gravitational lensing, and dark energy was discovered using one of his wide field CCD cameras. Prior to coming to UC Davis he worked in the physics division at Bell Labs.
