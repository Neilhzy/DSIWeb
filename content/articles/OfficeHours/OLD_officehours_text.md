*   __[Hugo Mailhot](mailto:hmailhot@ucdavis.edu)__: Natural Language Processing. 
The possibility to automatically analyze large collections of texts has opened many exciting possibilities in various disciplines, and the methods developed in NLP find useful applications even outside of  text analysis. Linguistics major and Computer Science PhD student Hugo is available for you to drop in and ask anything about NLP, from how to get started and whether it's appropriate for your research project, to troubleshooting in process analyses. Hugo has also worked as a researcher in industry (focusing on artificial intelligence) and is happy to talk about that experience.
