## Tuesdays 10am-noon
*   __[Hugo Mailhot](mailto:hmailhot@ucdavis.edu)__: Natural Language Processing. 
The possibility to automatically analyze large collections of texts has opened many exciting possibilities in various disciplines, and the methods developed in NLP find useful applications even outside of  text analysis. Linguistics major and Computer Science PhD student Hugo is available for you to drop in and ask anything about NLP, from how to get started and whether it's appropriate for your research project, to troubleshooting in process analyses. Hugo has also worked as a researcher in industry (focusing on artificial intelligence) and is happy to talk about that experience.

## Tuesdays 4-5pm
* __[Ruijuan Li](mailto:rzlli@ucdavis.edu)__: bioinformatics, R, git/github. 
Ruijuan is a postdoc in Plant Sciences. Her background is in plant genomics and bioinformatics. She has experience in R programming and RNA-sequencing data analysis, particularly for sequence alignment, expression analysis, variant calling, genome wide association study, QTL analysis, and genomic prediction.
	
*   __[Nick Bowden](mailto:nsbowden@ucdavis.edu)__: R, Python, visualization. 
    Nick is available for introductory (installations and getting started) with R
    and Python for web scraping, visualization and geocoding. Nick is in the
    Transportation Technology and Policy Graduate Group and his background is
    in economics (specifically energy economics and electric power system
    planning, operations and markets); he is studying environmental issues
    including carbon policy. His work has focused on high frequency time series
    modelling and cross-sectional and panel data models, and he has experience
    in visualizations in various platforms.
