# DSI Postdoc Office Hours

The DSI Postdoctoral Scholars are available for office hours in the DSI Classroom to
help with your data science problems. Drop-ins are welcome, but *we
recommended that you email the individual you want to meet with in advance* in
case of any schedule changes.

## Mondays 1-3pm
* __[Dan Hicks](mailto:djhicks@ucdavis.edu)__: Bibliometrics, R
	Dan is conducing research in data-driven academic institutional effectiveness. He received his PhD in philosophy from Notre Dame and MS in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, Chicago. Prior to coming to the DSI he was a AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellow at the EPA and NSF, and a postdoc at the University of Western Ontario. During office hours, Dan can provide feedback on: bibliometrics (Scopus, CrossRef web interface and API), beginner through intermediate skills in R (ggplot for plotting, igraph for network analysis, dplyr for SQL-like data wrangling, RStudio), and philosophical issues in statistics and Data Science (How do you decide between frequentist or Bayesian methods? What should you do about P-hacking and alpha cutoffs? How do you know you've picked the right test? etc.).

## Thursdays 3:15-5:15pm
* __[Jane Carlen](mailto:jacarlen@ucdavis.edu)__: R, Python, Stats, Network Analysis
	Jane is a postdoc at the DSI providing data science support for applied research throughout the university, and data science training for students and faculty. She received her PhD in Statistics from UCLA, where she studied social network models and network-based ranking. Prior to joining DSI she was the Research Statistician for the Economic Roundtable where she conducted statistical analysis related to homelessness and wage equity in California, and organized a multi-city data dive to study the Los Angeles homeless population. She is passionate about advancing statistical methodology in the social sciences, especially developing software that makes new methods accessible to practitioners. Outside the DSI she is an editor for the Journal of Statistical Software and enjoys reading about financial crises.
