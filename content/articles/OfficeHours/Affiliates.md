# Affiliate Office Hours

DSI Affiliates are available for drop-in office hours in the DSI Classroom to
help with your data science problems. Drop ins are welcome, but it is
recommended that you email the individual you want to meet with in advance in
case of any schedule changes.

## Mondays 11am-noon
* __[Ryan Philips](mailto:rcphilips@ucdavis.edu)__: SQL. 
    Ryan is a PhD student in neuroscience and can help you get started with and use SQL. When it comes to large (1M+ rows) datasets, the SQL family of languages is the industry standard for data manipulation and subsetting, but it can also be used for smaller-scale data analysis. Ryan can also assist with introductory to intermediate questions in Python, Git, command line, and R. He can also talk about his experience working at a startup in San Francisco.

## Fridays 2-3pm
*   __[Nistara Randhawa](mailto:nrandhawa@ucdavis.edu>)__: R, RStudio, GIS, visualization. 
    Nistara is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology and can provide help with R, including installing and setting up R/RStudio and
    troubleshooting code, writing R functions to improve code efficiency, and
    making basic R packages. She can introduce you to using git/github. She has
    experience with GIS and can help you get started with ArcMap or QGIS
    (including making maps and/or animations with GIS data, using leaflet with
    R for creating useful interactive maps). She can also advise with data
    visualization. She's also available to meet with undergraduates interested
    in pursuing data science. Her background includes Veterinary medicine,
    epidemiology and public health. Her interests also include science
    communication and videography.
