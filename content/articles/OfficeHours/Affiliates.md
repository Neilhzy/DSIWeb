# DSI Affiliate Office Hours

DSI Affiliates are available for drop-in office hours in the DSI Classroom to
help with your data science problems. Drop ins are welcome, but it is
recommended that you email the individual you want to meet with in advance in
case of any schedule changes.

## Tuesdays 10-11am
* __[Ryan Philips](mailto:rcphilips@ucdavis.edu)__: SQL, Ptyhon, R. 
    Ryan is a PhD student in neuroscience and can help you get started with and use SQL. When it comes to large (1M+ rows) datasets, the SQL family of languages is the industry standard for data manipulation and subsetting, but it can also be used for smaller-scale data analysis. Ryan can also assist with introductory to intermediate questions in Python, Git, command line, and R. He can also talk about his experience working at a startup in San Francisco.

## Tuesdays 11-1pm
* __[Hugo Mailhot](mailto:hmailhot@ucdavis.edu)_: Natural language processing (NLP), Python, Jupyter
	Hugo is a PhD student on Computer Science specialized in natural language processing. He's happy to discuss any NLP topic. He can also give advice on Python programming, interactive data analysis and development with Jupyter, and command line tools such as Git, Vim, Tmux, SSH, bash, and zsh.

## Wednesdays 11-12pm
* __[Nick Bowden](mailto:nsbowden@ucdavis.edu)_: R, Python, XML, pdfs.
	Nick Bowden is a PhD student in the Energy Graduate Group focusing on electric power system operations and economics. He works with R and Python to run cross-section, time series and panel data analysis with a focus on causal inference. He is using XML and web technologies like RCurl to pull information from html and pdf documents.

## Fridays 2-3pm
* __[Nistara Randhawa](mailto:nrandhawa@ucdavis.edu)__: R, RStudio, GIS, visualization. 
	Nistara is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology and can provide help with R, including installing and setting up R/RStudio and troubleshooting code, writing R functions to improve code efficiency, and making basic R packages. She can also introduce you to using git/github, getting started with ArcMap/QGIS and using R for creating interactive maps.
