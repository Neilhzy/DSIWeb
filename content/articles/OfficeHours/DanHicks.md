Dan Hicks is a postdoc at the DSI conducing research in data-driven academic
institutional effectiveness. He received his PhD in philosophy from Notre Dame
and MS in Mathematics from the University of Illinois, Chicago. Prior to coming

During office hours, Dan can provide feedback on:

* Bibliometrics: Scopus, CrossRef web interface and API
* Beginner through intermediate skills in R: ggplot for plotting, igraph for network analysis, dplyr for SQL-like data wrangling, RStudio
* Philosophical issues in statistics and Data Science (How do you decide between frequentist or Bayesian methods? What should you do about P-hacking and alpha cutoffs? How do you know you've picked the right test? etc.)

Note: Dan will be traveling intermittently to conferences in Spring 2018, so we strongly recommend emailing him prior to attending his office hours.
