Title: Workshop - Lessons from Binary Classification

Who: James Sharpnack
Quarter: Spring

In this second session, we will continue to explore machine learning with
data driven examples.

Binary classification is the canonical machine learning task and its study
has a rich history.  Much of the main principles of machine learning have
been discovered in this context.  These principles continue to guide the
broader development of machine learning, and they motivate methods such as
cross-validation, kernel support vector machines, logistic regression, and
neural networks.  We will highlight the resultant methods and will
accompany this with data driven examples.
