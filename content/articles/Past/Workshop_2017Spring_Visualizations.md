In this workshop, we'll discuss best practices for displaying different types of static data. This
is about designing data visualizations rather than the software and instructions we use to actually
render them. We'll cover some basic principles to keep in mind, explore different types of plots,
critique some good and bad examples of displaying data and how to think about creating effective
plots.
