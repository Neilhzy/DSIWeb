# Ultra-Basic Introduction to the Command Line and Git

Description: Basic skills using the Unix/Linux command line and the Git version control system are prerequisite to the application of
nearly all digital methods. This workshop will offer a down and dirty, no holds barred introduction to both.  While
both technologies are rich and multi-faceted, this workshop does not, by design, aim towards comprehensiveness nor
complete mastery. Rather, it is designed to introduce participants to a basic toolkit that will allow them to perform
most tasks regularly required of beginning developers.
