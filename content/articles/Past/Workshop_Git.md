# Slash and Burn Command Line and Git

A hands-on practicum on the UNIX/Linux command line and Git version
control during which we'll learn the basics of getting around using a
command line shell and using Git to manage files. No prior experience
is necessary.  We'll download all the needed software and get it
installed on our machines together, have some directed play on the
command line, connect to a remote Git repository, and push a repo and
commits to our own, remote Git repositories.  We’ll spend very little
time talking about what’s under the hood or investigating the many
powerful tools that Git offers for advanced users.  The workshop is a
boots-on-the-ground, get your hands dirty practicum designed to get
you up and running on your own computer and give you skills necessary
to start using command line Git.  (Note: if you don’t know what the
command line is, you should definitely take this workshop.) No
previous programming or Unix command line experience is necessary.
This is a hands-on workshop, so participants must bring a laptop on
which they have administrative privileges (the ability to install
software) to the workshop.
