##Description:
The aim of this course is to help participants understand the
relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R
language. This will help you reason about code before you write
and run it, and to debug it if it doesn't do what you want.  A sound
understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much
easier and more productive. Basically, we want you to understand how
the R interpreter works. 

##Prerequisites:
This is not an introductory course. Participants are expected to have an
elementary understanding and prior experience using R, be comfortable 
with basic R syntax, and to have it pre-installed and running on their laptops. 
This course is appropriate for motivated beginners as well as intermediate 
to advanced users who want a better understanding of base R. It is open
to UC Davis faculty, graduate students, postdocs, staff, and undergraduates; 
DSI affiliates will receive priority registration. Not sure if this course is
appropriate for you? Contact us (datascience@ucdavis.edu).

##Expectations:
This mini-course is intended as an active engagement and not a passive
lecture series.  We want you to come to each session with questions
about why some things worked and others didn't, and to actively learn.
Each session includes hands-on “lab” time for you to bring your own data to
work with and ask questions, which will help everyone understand and 
problem solve. Participants are expected to attend all of the 4 sessions.

##Topics (including but not limited to):
*__What is a REPL
*__The Global workspace/environment
*__Variables and Assignment (=, <- )
*__Basic data types – vectors
*__Hierarchy of data types and implicit coercion
*__Querying an object:  class, typeof, length, dim, names, str
*__Subsetting rules
*__Categorical data – factors
*__Aggregate functions - sum, mean, summary, table,
*__Vectorized functions
*__Apply functions
*__How function calls work
*__Lists
*__Data Frames
*__Subsetting in 2-Dimensions
*__Scoping Rules
*__Writing Functions
*__Debugging

Possible additional topics may include: the R formula; S3 class system; Writing Packages; NAMESPACE files; S4 class system.
