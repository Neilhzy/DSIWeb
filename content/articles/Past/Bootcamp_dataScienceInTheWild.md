Are you a postdoctoral researcher or PhD candidate looking to transition into a career in industry? Do you want a career that leverages your quantitative experience in a fast-growing and in-demand field? We invite you to attend an interactive workshop with Katie Amrine and Wafa Soofi, program directors and data scientists at Insight Data Science in Silicon Valley. The workshop will focus on the topic: "What makes a good data science project?" We will also touch on general tips for preparing for a data science interview. Insight is an intensive, seven-week postdoctoral training fellowship that bridges the gap between academia and a career in data science. Based in Silicon Valley, Boston, and NYC, the program enables scientists to learn the industry specific skills needed to work in the growing field of big data at leading technology companies. This workshop is intended for anyone who is interested in data science; all backgrounds are welcome! We have limited available seats. Please [RSVP ASAP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbLlMkdin8T3OH7pF3vSIGvVVi4KOO_zQoTsDU1XKPeqSoOw/viewform?c=0&w=1).
