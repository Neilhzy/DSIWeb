A couple of the DSI affiliates will gather for a mini hack day to work on 
some short data science projects this friday.
We will learn from each other and see if we can form teams 
to work on the same project(s).

Venue: the DSI space on the 3rd floor of the Shields library (link to directions)
Date: this Friday 09/09/2016
Time: 9:30 am - 5:00 pm This is flexible and you do not have to stay the entire time.
