# June 9, 2017: Data Visualization Principles (Duncan Temple Lang)

In this workshop, we'll discuss best practices for displaying different
types of static data. This is about designing data visualizations rather
than the software and instructions we use to actually render them. We'll
cover some basic principles to keep in mind, explore different types of
plots, critique some good and bad examples of displaying data and how to
think about creating effective plots.
