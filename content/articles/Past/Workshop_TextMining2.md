# Natural Language Processing:  Text Normalization and Entity Extraction

This hands-on workshop will introduce a collection of basic practices in Natural Language
Processing.  Topics covered will include: Named entity extraction, part of speech tagging, stemming,
and lemmatization.  Participants must have some programming experience in R and familiarity with the
Unix command line and Git. (Participation in the January 20th workshop on Slash and Burn Command
Line and Git and the February 3rd workshop on Text Mining Fundamentals will prepare you well for
this workshop.) Please come to the workshop with a working R development environment and Git already
installed and operational on your system.
