# Beginner Git

Description: Git and related systems are key for replicability when doing any kind of computational analysis. This
introductory workshop will cover creating a repository, recording and viewing changes to files, ignoring files, working
with GitHub online, resolving conflicts, open licenses, and where to host work.

This workshop will be taught remotely and broadcast to our classroom
via Google Hangouts on Air. We will have helpers in our local room to
facilitate the lesson. The lesson will also be streamed to YouTube and
saved there for viewing at a later time.
