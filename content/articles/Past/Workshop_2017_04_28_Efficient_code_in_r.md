April 28: __Efficient Code in R__ (Duncan Temple Lang)
   
It is relatively easy to write R code quickly, but harder to write quick R
code. We'll discuss some general strategies for writing faster R code and
then explore R tools for finding bottlenecks in code and how to make these
faster. We'll use one or two in-depth case studies to see the process and
reasoning you would use on code. We'll also look at alternative approaches
to making code faster by integrating other languages, e.g., the shell, SQL
and databases, and C and C++. The intent is to show that these are quite
accessible.

_Prerequisites: This is an intermediate/advanced workshop and attendees are
expected to have a working knowledge of R._
