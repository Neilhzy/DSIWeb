# Advanced Text Mining

This workshop will take both a conceptual and practical deep dive into clustering and classification methods, broadly
known as topic modeling.  We examine the application of a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques,
including a discussion of the statistical methods behind the curtain in order learn how and when to apply a particular
method.  The workshop will involve both discussion and practical application.  Prior experience with R and intermediate
text mining techniques is required.
