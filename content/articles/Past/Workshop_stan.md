# Introduction to Bayesian Modeling Using Stan

This talk will explore Bayesian modeling using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We will
start with a crash course in Bayesian modeling, show when and why MCMC methods are needed, and then
will touch on the pros and cons of various different MCMC samplers with hands-on examples. The talk
will end with a demonstration of using Stan through multiple interfaces (R, command line, etc).
