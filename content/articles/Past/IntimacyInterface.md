# Intimacy & Interface: Software Prototyping for a New Media

<p>This talk will explore the implications of "intimacy" and how it rubs against the dogma of automation in the computer
science field. A selection of prototypes, work and sketches will be shown, re-imagining our relationship to archive and
media, through a discussion about what it means to "interface" with the past, with the present, and with one
another. Several audiovisual tools for analysis and exploration will also be shared and installed in the Digital
Scholarship and Data Science Labs, for research uses within the campus community.
