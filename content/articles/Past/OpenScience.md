# Open Science Framework Workshop

There are many actions researchers can take to increase the openness and reproducibility of their work. Please join us
for a workshop, hosted by the Center for Open Science, to learn easy, practical steps researchers can take to increase
the reproducibility of their work. The workshop will be handsÂ­ on. Using example studies, attendees will actively
participate in creating a reproducible project from start to finish.
<p> 
Topics covered:
<ul>
<li>Project documentation</li>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>Pre-Analysis plans</li>
<li>Open source tools, such as the Center for Open Science's Open Science Framework, which can be thought of as an
electronic notebook that easily integrates the aforementioned concepts in a workflow.</li>
</ul>
</p>
This workshop is aimed at faculty, staff, and students across disciplines, who are engaged in quantitative research. The
workshop does not require any specialized knowledge of programming. Participants will gain a foundation for
incorporating reproducible, transparent practices into their current workflows.
