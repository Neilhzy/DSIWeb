# Intermediate Text Mining

This is mid-level workshop will introduce concepts that drive more advanced text mining methods and their
implementation.  Through a mix of lecture and practicum, participants will learn about and implement methods such as
stemming and lemmatization, segmentation, and term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis.  Workshop participants
need not be proficient programmers, but should have experience using R to perform basic forms of analysis such as word
frequency and key word in contect.  We will write code communally, one step at a time, as way of introducing technical
skills while achieving computational results.
