# Text Mining Fundamentals

This workshop will introduce basic concepts in text mining and Natural Language processing through
discussion and hands-on coding of text processing functions that lay the groundwork for nearly all
text mining processes.  No prior programming experience is necessary to take the workshop; however,
familiarity with the command line and Git is a prerequisite.  (Participation in the February 3rd
workshop on command line and Git will prepare you well for this workshop.)  We'll code together as a
group, leaving no text-miner behind.  Topics covered will include: Word frequency analysis, basic
chunking/tokenization, token distribution, and keyword in context (KWIC) analysis.  Please come to
the workshop with a working R development environment and Git already installed and operational on
your system.
