# Advanced Beginner Python

So you've written some Python code and it works! Now what?

This half day workshop will explore "next steps" in Python
programming:
* reusing code by placing it in importable modules
* code organization overall
* handling command line arguments with argparse

* using virtualenv to install isolated collections of software on
  shared machines

Attendees should have some Python experience, but need not be experts.
