# Introductory Text Mining

An entry-level workshop that introduces key concepts in text mining and basic tools and programming skills needed to
implement foundational methods.  In addition to examining what can and cannot be discovered through computational text
analysis, a hands on component will include an introduction to the R programming language as well as coding some basic
analysis functions including word frequency, token distribution, and key word in context.  Participants should must have
a basic knowledge of the Unix/Linux command line and the Git version control system, but noprior programming experience
is needed to successfully engage in the workshop. We will write code communally, one step at a time, as a way of
introducing technical skills while achieving computational results.
