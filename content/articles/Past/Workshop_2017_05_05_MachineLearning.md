May 5 & 12, 2017: __Machine Learning__ (James Sharpnack)

In this workshop, we'll discuss best practices for displaying different
types of static data. This is about designing data visualizations rather
 than the software and instructions we use to actually render them. We'll
 cover some basic principles to keep in mind, explore different types of
 plots, critique some good and bad examples of displaying data and how to
 think about creating effective plots.

May 5: Part I - Lessons from Binary Classification: Overfitting and surrogate losses (James Sharpnack)
Binary classification is the canonical machine learning task and its study has a rich history.  Much of the main principles of machine learning have been discovered in this context.  These principles continue to guide the broader development of machine learning, and they motivate methods such as cross-validation, kernel support vector machines, logistic regression, and neural networks.  We will highlight the resultant methods and will accompany this with data driven examples. To best prepare for the workshop, bring a laptop pre-loaded with jupyter, python, numpy and scikit-learn (they can be installed through anaconda, https://anaconda.org/anaconda). 

May 12: Part II - Lessons from Binary Classification: Non-parametric methods and the kernel trick (James Sharpnack)
In this second session, we will continue to explore machine learning with data driven examples.
