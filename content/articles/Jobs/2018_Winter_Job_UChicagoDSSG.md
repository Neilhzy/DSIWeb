# Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship at the University of Chicago

## Description
The Data Science for Social Good Fellowship is a University of Chicago summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on data mining, machine learning, big data, and data science projects with social impact. Working closely with governments and nonprofits, fellows take on real-world problems in education, health, energy, public safety, transportation, economic development, international development, and more.

For three months in Chicago they learn, hone, and apply their data science, analytical, and coding skills, collaborate in a fast-paced atmosphere, and learn from mentors coming from industry and academia.

In addition to the summer fellows, the Center for Data Science and Public Policy at Univ. Chicago also hires Post-docs, Research Assistants, Data Scientists, and Project Partners. For more information on those positions, see: http://dsapp.uchicago.edu/jobs/.
