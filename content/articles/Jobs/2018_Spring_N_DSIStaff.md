## About the DSI

The UC Davis Data Science Initiative (DSI) was founded to promote and support research and training in data-driven discovery across all colleges, schools and disciplines at UC Davis. We facilitate data-enabled research and training at the frontiers of scientific, engineering, social and humanities disciplines.  A highly interdisciplinary, cross-university entity, the DSI serves as a hub for a community of researchers and students from many domains interested in data science and pushing the envelope of research in the digital age.  The DSI coordinates data-science training activities, provides consulting and collaborative services for research projects, and conducts novel research in data science. We run training workshops on fundamental and intermediate to advanced data science topics. We run problem-solving “un-seminars”, reading groups, and generally foster community. Our research and training activities span the entire research data pipeline, from data acquisition, management, cleaning, transformation, visualization, and modeling to dissemination/publication and high-performance computing, and involve aspects of data governance, security, privacy and ethics. The DSI is committed to fostering an inclusive environment to promote all members of the university community, including faculty, students and staff from a variety of domains, backgrounds, cultures and personal experiences.
