# Data, Informatics & Application Launch (DIAL™) Grant Pilot Program: FY 2017-18

*The deadline for applications is Monday, March 5, 2018, at 5pm.*  

## Description:

The UC Davis Data, Informatics & Application Launch (DIAL) Grant Program is a pilot funding program available in the 2017-18 fiscal year, funded by the Office of Research under the State of California’s AB-2664 legislative initiative and managed by UC Davis Venture Catalyst.  While the program may be offered in subsequent years, it is currently being offered and managed as a one-time pilot program.  The objective of the DIAL Grant Program is to provide targeted funding to support translational science and innovative research performed by UC Davis researchers, with the intent of demonstrating commercial potential, proof-of-concept or other outcomes that improve or clarify the commercialization risk profile for data, information science or software and related applications being developed at UC Davis.  Key features of the DIAL grant program include 1) feedback to all applicants and 2) an active mentoring component for applicants.  More information about last year’s DIAL program can be found in the [2016-17 STAIR/DIAL Program Executive Summary](http://research.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/STAIR-DIAL-ExecSumm_2016-17.pdf).  A list of previous award winners can be found [here](http://research.ucdavis.edu/offices/vc/stair/stair-grant-2013-14-awardees/).

In 2016-17, a total of $56,547 in DIAL Grant monies was awarded to fund three different proposals.  In 2017-18, a total of $60,000 in DIAL Grant funding is available, with maximum allowable funding of $20,000 per successful DIAL grant recipient.
