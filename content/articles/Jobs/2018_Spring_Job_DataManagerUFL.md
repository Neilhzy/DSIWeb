# Data Manager in Spatial Ecology Lab at University of Florida, Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center

### Description
The MMBLAB, which focuses on spatial ecology, is recruiting to fill an immediate opening for a Biological Scientist for Data Management. The Data Manager will be responsible for the group’s database system, and will assist with multiple projects investigating for instance animal fine-scale movement in urban areas, or migration and range dynamics in the context of climate change.

### Responsibilities

The primary mission of the Data Manager will be to manage the group’s database system: we run a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database system on a Linux server, which hosts telemetry data on wood storks, sea turtles, raccoons, and associated GIS layers. In the near future, we will be adding advanced data from albatrosses, including accelerometers and infrasound. The Data Manager will manage the database server (database design, manual and automated data entry, metadata, set permissions for users and groups, backups, development of web apps to access and display data, etc.). Additional responsibilities will include assisting members of the group with data processing, and maintaining our open source R packages (rpostgis, rpostgisLT, hab…).

Familiarity with SQL is essential. Experience using PostgreSQL/PostGIS (or other SIG database systems) and R is a plus, as well as experience with Linux systems and database servers.
The candidate must be able to work independently and with others in a fast-paced environment, and should be comfortable working across agency boundaries (University of Florida, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey and the National Park Service, etc.), making excellent written and oral communication skills essential for this position.

### Qualifications

B.S. with experience in Data Science, Computing, GIS, Biology or a related field. Must be eligible to work in the United States.
