# Statistical Data Analyst Job at UCLA Policy Lab in Sacramento, CA

The California Policy Lab at UCLA is working with the Employment Development Department in Sacramento to place a full time statistical data analyst within EDD beginning this summer. The statistical data analyst will work on a variety of projects in labor economics using on a range of confidential administrative data sets held by EDD and almost never seen by outside researchers. Responsibilities will include detailed documentation of the trends, features, and peculiarities in EDDâ€™s data, conducting probabilistic merges between large administrative datasets, and conducting statistical analyses in close collaboration with CPL Faculty Director Till von Wachter. The term of this position is 12 months, with the possibility of renewal for up to 24 additional months. Candidates must have exceptionally strong data cleaning and processing skills, as well as very strong written communication skills. The analysts at EDD all use SAS, so preference will be given to candidates with prior knowledge of that language. We also strongly prefer candidates with at least two years of professional experience. 

The California Policy Lab is a new initiative at UCLA and UC Berkeley that conducts applied research in the areas of labor, poverty, homelessness, criminal justice and education. We partner with state and local agencies, nonprofits and policymakers to develop and evaluate interventions to improve social programs and outcomes. Till von Wachter is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of California Los Angeles, Associate Director of the California Center for Population Research, and director of the Federal Statistical Research Data Center at UCLA.
