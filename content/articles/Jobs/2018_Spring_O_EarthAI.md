# AI for Earth Grant from Microsoft

In collaboration with Esri's outreach team, the Microsoft AI for Earth program awards advanced Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources and powerful Esri GIS tools to individuals and organizations working on environmental and conservation programs aimed towards transforming the way we are currently managing complex environmental challenges.

Grantees get access to Microsoft Azure cloud computing resources and a variety of data science and machine learning tools, including powerful assets in the the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and the GeoAI Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). Grantees will receive 12 months of free resources worth $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, depending on project needs. 

AI for Earth program activity is focused on four areas that are vital for building a sustainable future: 
- Agriculture: To feed the world's rapidly growing population, farmers must produce more food, on less arable land and with lower environmental impact. 
- Water: In the next two decades, demand for fresh water - for human consumption, agriculture, and hygiene - is predicted to dramatically outpace supply. 
- Biodiversity: Species are going extinct beyond the natural rate by orders of magnitude, driving the decay of key ecosystem services, like pollination, that humans depend upon. 
- Climate change: An increasingly variable climate - extreme weather events, rising sea levels, higher global temperatures, and increased ocean acidity - threaten human health, infrastructure, and the natural systems we rely on for life itself. 

## Eligibility
Applicants must be affiliated with an academic institution or non-profit research laboratory. Faculty, researchers, and graduate students are qualified to submit proposals for Azure awards--masters and undergraduate students require a faculty project supervisor to submit their proposal.  Individual and organizations are eligible to apply.
