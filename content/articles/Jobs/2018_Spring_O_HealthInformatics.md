# 2018 Call for Applications: International PhD /Graduate Fellowship Program 

UC Davis, CITRIS-Health and Universities in Denmark and Scandinavia are excited to offer a call for applications to a unique interdisciplinary and international academic training opportunity in applied health informatics. Students will participate in an intensive program held at University of California, Davis, August 13 - August 17th 2018. 

Deadline for application to this program is *April 25th.*  Questions can be directed to [PersonalizedHealthProgram@ucdavis.edu](mailto:PersonalizedHealthProgram@ucdavis.edu).

## Program structure:
This course is oriented to advanced graduate students seeking a comprehensive introduction to methods of design, assessment and implementation in personalized health informatics  The program will focus on the current and next generation of technologies, research design methodologies, health communities and models of digital health care, and will have interdisciplinary faculty and students from policy to engineering. 

Learning goals for students include:

* Advanced study in design, testing, assessment and implementation of personalized informatics and patient-centered technology for patients and communities 
* Collaborative network development with students and international researchers within telehealth and personalized health informatics

Program thematic areas include:

* Usability, design thinking and participatory design 
* Human centered interface design and evaluation methods
* Data acquisition methods for instrument and self-reported health data
* Development of digital phenotyping for health monitoring
* Data analytics of large scale mobile and clinical data
* Assessment of the value of digital health care interventions
* Ethical, legal and social issues in research and dissemination of personal health technology Academic Credit 

University of California students will receive 1-3 units of graduate credit with their home department or school. Danish and Scandinavian students will receive 5 ECTS points Student completing this course will have unique and advanced skills and potential US and international research collaborations. 

## Dates and Locations:
The program will be held at Davis and Sacramento locations of the University of California, Davis, August 13th-17th 2018. Students will participate in an intensive 5-day program with peer students, researchers and industry leaders from Europe and the US.

## Facts about TTRN  
The Transatlantic Telehealth Research Network (TTRN) is dedicated to developing cutting-edge research and innovation within telehealth. The research is interdisciplinary (medicine, engineering, nursing, organizational, economic, policy); and focuses on developing new diagnostic, preventive care and treatment methods/technologies for patients in their own homes utilizing telehealth. Problem-based, user-driven innovation is a key issue in the international and interdisciplinary TTRN. Partners in the TTRN  Citris, UC Berkeley; Betty Irene Moore Nursing School; CHT, UC Davis Health; Cleveland Clinic; Connected Health Innovation, Harvard Medical School, Boston; Center for Innovative Medical Technologies (CIMT), Odense University Hospital & Southern Danish University; Department of Photonics Engineering, Danish Technical University; Department of Psychology, Aarhus University and Department of Health Science and Technology, Aalborg University.
