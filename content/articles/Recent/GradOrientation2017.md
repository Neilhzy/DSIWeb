New digital technology has led to exponential growth in the amount and complexity of data, from text to images to numerical data. This poses an incredible opportunity to push the envelope within and across scientific, engineering and social fields. In this workshop we will highlight best practices for data management, data science research, and training and services at UC Davis. We will showcase examples of how students from across the university can interact with the Data Science Initiative and the Library's Data and Digital Scholarship department at all stages of their careers to achieve their research goals and build transferrable skillsets for life after graduate school. This workshop is free and is held in conjunction with the [UC Davis Graduate Student Orientation](https://grad.ucdavis.edu/node/40608/). Incoming graduate students from all disciplines are encouraged to attend.
