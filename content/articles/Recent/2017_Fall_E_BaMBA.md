Meeting at Genentech Hall, UCSF , 9am-6pm on November 18th, 2017

[Meeting Website](https://bambameeting.org/)

Description: BaMBA is a one-day meeting aimed at exploring the role of mathematics in biology in an informal atmosphere. Going beyond traditional applied mathematics, the topics include applications of algebraic, topological, statistical and computational methods. The goal is to encourage dialogue between researchers and students from different disciplines to promote the open exchange of scientific ideas and viewpoints.
 
Participation in BaMBA is free and open to everyone, but registration is required. Attendance is limited to 200 participants. The registration deadline is *Monday November 13th, 2017.* Undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs involved in mathematical and computational investigations of biological systems are invited to submit an abstract for a poster presentation.   

Please use this link to register for the meeting and submit a poster abstract:
