# Affiliate Office Hours
DSI affiliates are available for drop-in office hours in the DSI Classroom to help with your data science problems. Drop ins are welcome, but it is recommended that you email the individual you want to meet with in advance in case of any schedule changes.

## Mondays 11am-noon
* __[Ryan Philips](mailto:rcphilips@ucdavis.edu)__: SQL
    Ryan is a PhD student in neuroscience and can help you get started with and use SQL. When it comes to large (1M+ rows) datasets, the SQL family of languages is the industry standard for data manipulation and subsetting, but it can also be used for smaller-scale data analysis. Ryan can also assist with introductory to intermediate questions in Python, Git, command line, and R. He can also talk about his experience working at a startup in San Francisco.

## Tuesdays 10am-noon
*   __[Hugo Mailhot](mailto:hmailhot@ucdavis.edu)__: Natural Language Processing
The possibility to automatically analyze large collections of texts has opened many exciting possibilities in various disciplines, and the methods developed in NLP find useful applications even outside of  text analysis. Linguistics major and Computer Science PhD student Hugo is available for you to drop in and ask anything about NLP, from how to get started and whether it's appropriate for your research project, to troubleshooting in process analyses. Hugo has also worked as a researcher in industry (focusing on artificial intelligence) and is happy to talk about that experience.

## Tuesdays 1-3pm
*   __[Nistara Randhawa](mailto:nrandhawa@ucdavis.edu>)__: R, RStudio, GIS, visualization
    Nistara is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology and can provide help with R, including installing and setting up R/RStudio and
    troubleshooting code, writing R functions to improve code efficiency, and
    making basic R packages. She can introduce you to using git/github. She has
    experience with GIS and can help you get started with ArcMap or QGIS
    (including making maps and/or animations with GIS data, using leaflet with
    R for creating useful interactive maps). She can also advise with data
    visualization. She's also available to meet with undergraduates interested
    in pursuing data science. Her background includes Veterinary medicine,
    epidemiology and public health. Her interests also include science
    communication and videography.
*   __[Nick Bowden](mailto:nsbowden@ucdavis.edu)__: R, Python, visualization
    Nick is available for introductory (installations and getting started) with R
    and Python for web scraping, visualization and geocoding. Nick is in the
    Transportation Technology and Policy Graduate Group and his background is
    in economics (specifically energy economics and electric power system
    planning, operations and markets); he is studying environmental issues
    including carbon policy. His work has focused on high frequency time series
    modelling and cross-sectional and panel data models, and he has experience
    in visualizations in various platforms.
