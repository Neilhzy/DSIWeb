# Seeking Speakers for Fall Problem Solving Seminar

The DSI holds an "unseminar" series and we are seeking speakers.
These are researchers from **any discipline** that are struggling
with a Data Science problem in a project or who are conceptualizing
a problem that involves a Data Science problem.
The speaker presents the problem in a 10-15 minute talk and then
the multidisciplinary audience asks more questions and
provides suggestions, possible approaches, related technologies, etc.

This is a lot of fun and very educational for everyone.
Often the speaker gets an answer to their problem or a very good lead.
We have had collaborations established, even leading to grant proposals.
Students learn about diverse Data Science problems and different technologies and methods.
Importantly, we see how to think about interdisciplinary issues and talk across disciplines.

If you are interested in giving a talk, please [send us an email](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu)
giving us a short outline of the problem.
