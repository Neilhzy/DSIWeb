Abstract: 

In 2015, hundreds of scholars, government representatives, and journalists gathered in Washington, DC for the [International Summit on Human Gene Editing](http://www.nationalacademies.org/gene-editing/Gene-Edit-Summit/index.htm). The Summit was billed as an interdisciplinary discussion of ethical, legal, and social aspects of genome modification, but official discussion consisted almost entirely of highly planned presentations on field-specific concerns.  An unofficial, parallel conference formed in the Twitterverse. Actual and virtual conference attendees appropriated the #GeneEditSummit hashtag to raise issues such as gender, reproductive justice, race, sexuality, disability, global health disparities, and sexism in STEM fields. 

This research project uses feminist scholarship to examine the ethics of gene modification technologies as framed in the Summit talk transcriptions (18 hours, ~101,000 words) and corresponding 3,205 #GeneEditSummit tweets. The immediate goals are to develop a pipeline for unifying these data types and build a sharable database for ongoing and future scholarship. To accomplish this, we seek feedback on:
* 1) correlating transcripts and tweets,
* 2) ensuring accessible data formats,
* 3) developing an online platform for scholars engaged in similar research, and 
* 4) visualization options for exploratory data analysis.

Example topics from the talks and tweets
