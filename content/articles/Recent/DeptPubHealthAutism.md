Department of Public Health Sciences at UC Davis has openings for positions in Genomics & Epigenomics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

Work with a multi-disciplinary team of researchers on autism research studies with unique availability of environmental, genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and diagnostic data. 

Required:
*	Skills in Big Data analytics, data mining, or applied statistics
*	Availability to work 12+ hours per week   

Expertise:
*	Training and/or work experience in: analysis of genetic, epigenetic or gene expression data; genetic epidemiology with –omic data or other data mining’ or gene-by-environment interactions
*	Strong oral and written communication skills

Desirable:
*	Familiarity with gene ontology and/or toxicogenomic databases
*	Completed coursework in epidemiology, bioinformatics, genomics, biostatistics, or related field

Description:
This position will conduct analysis of data for research on risk factors for ASD as part of the Program in Environmental Epidemiology of Autism and Neurodevelopment, which includes the CHARGE (CHildhood Autism Risks from Genes & Environment) and MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies—Learning Early Signs) studies. These studies have collected phenotype, environmental, medical, nutritional, sociodemographic, and behavioral variables, as well as genomic and epigenomic data on study participants and their families. The goals of this research are to determine how genetics and non-genetic factors interact in relation to child developmental outcomes. Both hypothesis-driven analyses and non-targeted data exploration will be pursued. To date, this program has published dozens of papers on targeted environmental exposures (air pollution, pesticides, nutrition), biologic markers (immune, mitochondrial, epigenetic), gene-by-environment interactions, and phenotypic variation, comparing children with ASD to children with other developmental disorders or typical development.
