# R Fundamentals - Part II

To register, select the appropriate workshop [here](https://forms.library.ucdavis.edu/classes/descriptions.php#class174).

## Description:
This 3-part workshop series led by DSI Director and Professor of Statistics Duncan Temple Lang explores the underlying computational model of the R language. It is strongly encouraged, although not required, that you attend all three sessions as they build upon each other. A longer version of this series was taught in the DSI as a [mini-course in summer 2017](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/posts/Workshop/RFundamental20170711.html). 

The aim of this series is to help participants understand the
relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R
language. This will help you reason about code before you write
and run it, and to debug it if it doesn't do what you want.  A sound
understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much
easier and more productive. Basically, we want you to understand how
the R interpreter works. 

##Prerequisites:
This is not an introduction to R. Participants are expected to have an
elementary understanding and prior experience using R, be comfortable 
with basic R syntax, and to have it pre-installed and running on their laptops. 
This series is appropriate for motivated beginners as well as intermediate 
to advanced users who want a better understanding of base R. It is open
to UC Davis faculty, graduate students, postdocs, staff, and undergraduates; 
DSI affiliates receive priority registration.
