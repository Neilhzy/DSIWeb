# Meetup: Teaching data science & computational skills

The DSI and [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) host semi-monthly meetups for instructors, faculty, researchers and learners interested in data science pedagogy and improving teaching of scientific computational skills. Meetups focus on debriefing recent workshops and courses, planning future training events, and sharing best practices for teaching from the ground up. Questions? Email [Pamela Reynolds](mailto:plreynolds@ucdavis.edu) or [Karen Word](mailto:krword@carpentries.org).
