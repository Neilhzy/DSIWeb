# Reproducibility, Replicability, & Scientific Integrity: Part I

The DSI is hosting an interactive, multidisciplinary talk series focusing on the issues of reproducibility and replicability in science. The aim is to bring together scholars from across disciplines at UC Davis, and individuals at all career stages (undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, faculty, staff) are welcome to attend. The topics covered will include open science, scientific integrity, transparency and openness, credibility, philosophy and ethics of science, incentive structures in science, and meta-science, among others. The emphasis will be on big picture issues that cut across disciplines, rather than on technical skills or statistical issues within a given domain.  No prior experience or expertise is necessary, all are welcome!

The group's activities may include discussions groups, workshops, and mini-conferences in addition to the brown bag talks.  If you are interested in presenting or organizing an activity, please contact [datascience@ucdavis.edu](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu). The group is organized by Pamela Reynolds and Duncan Temple Lang at the Data Science Initiative, and [Simine Vazire](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/svazire) from the Psychology Department.
