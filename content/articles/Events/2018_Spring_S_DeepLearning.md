#  Deep Learning for Science

*Special guest seminar hosted by Physics & the Data Science Initiative by Mr. Prabhat*

Abstract: Deep Learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision, speech recognition and robotics in recent years. Can Deep Learning work for science? This talk will review results from the application of Deep Learning to problems in climate, astronomy, cosmology, neuroscience, genomics and high-energy physics. We will review the landscape of data analytics problems in science, comment on the applicability of Deep Learning to a subset of problems, and call out open challenges for the future. The talk will conclude with a speculation about the future of AI in scientific discovery.
