# Affiliates Coffee Hour

The DSI hosts weekly coffee networking hours for our graduate student and postdoctoral Affiliates. This week's special guest is our DSI postdoc, [Matt Espe](https://mespe.github.io/). Matt's background is in plant sciences and agriculture. At the DSI Matt has been developing new tools (R packages, libraries, models) to enable researchers to increase and expand their research capacity across domains ranging from epidemiology to political sciences.

This event is open to all current  and active DSI Affiliates. To learn more and to apply to be a DSI Affiliate, see [here](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/membership.html).
