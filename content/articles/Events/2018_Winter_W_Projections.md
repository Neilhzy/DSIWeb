# Projections for Spatial Data in R
*or, why does my data not line up in this map?!*

## Description:

If you’ve ever worked with spatial data, you’ve had one of those moments – two datasets that are for the same geographic location show up in two different countries in a map or you run a spatial analysis process and come up with an empty result. Why? The answer often has to do with projections. In this workshop, we’ll clarify some of the mysteries of working with projections and discuss how to avoid common mistakes. For hands-on experience, we’ll work with R, but the concepts will apply to any GIS tool or spatial database. This workshop is led by the University Library's GIS Curator Michele Tobias. For questions or to send suggestions for future workshop topics, email datascience@ucdavis.edu.

Prerequisites: 
Basic R programming, basic understanding of GIS concepts
