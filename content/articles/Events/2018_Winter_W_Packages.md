# Working with and Creating R Packages

Description:
This Data Science Initiative (DSI) workshop is all about R packages - both using them effectively, creating them for your own use, and how to create and publish packages for others.  Packages can be used to simplify your own workflows by organizing and installing data and/or your own code across different projects and across different machines.  They also share your ideas and functionality with others and can count as "publications". Packages are very simple to create, once you know how.  And this workshop will address all levels of working with packages. This workshop is led by the DSI Director and Professor of Statistics, Duncan Temple Lang.  For questions or to send suggestions for future workshop topics, email datascience@ucdavis.edu.

Prerequisites: 
Only basic knowledge of R required.
