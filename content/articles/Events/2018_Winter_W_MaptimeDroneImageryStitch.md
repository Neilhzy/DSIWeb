# #MaptimeDavis Workshop Series: Drone Imagery Stitching

## Description:
The UC Davis Library’s Data Management Program & the [UC Davis Center for Spatial Sciences](https://spatial.ucdavis.edu/) are proud to present #maptimeDavis, a geospatial skills workshop series.  Maptime is quite literally “time for making maps”.  The primary goals of Maptime Davis is to teach skills related to mapping and to provide a forum for the Davis Community to find others with similar interests to facilitate learning. The repository for materials for this workshop series, including past workshops, are located on the [#maptimeDavis repository](https://github.com/MicheleTobias/MaptimeDavis).
