#  “Practical introduction to text mining”
This DSI workshop, led by Associate Director Dr. Carl Stahmer, will focus on doing and interpreting basic text analyses. 

Topics will include:
* word frequency and distribution
* bigram networks
* parts of speech tagging
* named entity extraction
* sentiment analysis

Prerequisites: Beginner R skills and working R environment with the following packages installed: tm, RWeka, mahout, qdap, koRpus, openNLP, ggplot2, rJava. NOTE: mahout is not available for the most recent version of R, and rJava can be tricky to install*. Come to [Office Hours](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/office_hours.html) prior to the workshop if you need help getting it installed.

*If you are having errors calling rJava and are on windows 64-bit machine, check that you have the [64-bit version of Java installed](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) as well as the 32-bit version. Then re-install the rJava package and load that library.
