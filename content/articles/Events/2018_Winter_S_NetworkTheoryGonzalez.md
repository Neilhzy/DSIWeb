# Seminar Series - Network Theory

UC Davis is hosting an exciting series of talks and visits in association with the Network Theory HIP program. The speakers are accomplished scholars in network theory, with diverse research spanning computer science, physics, and data science. Refreshments and time for conversation will immediately follow after the talks. Please join us so that we can highlight to these accomplished individuals the vigor of interdisciplinary science activities ongoing across the UC Davis campus. Please email [Dr. Raissa D'Souza](mailto:raissa@cse.ucdavis.edu) if you would like to arrange an individual research meeting with any of the speakers.  

## Tuesday, March 13
Speaker: Marta Gonzalez, Associate Professor, Department of City and Regional Planning at UC Berkeley 
Title: *"Data Science to study Macroscopic Dynamics in Urban Traffic Networks and Planning Urban Systems"
Schedule:
* Talk 3:10-4pm in 1131 Kemper 
* 4-4:30pm refreshments and Q&A
* 4:30-5pm open session with all interested students

**Please contact Prof. D'Souza (raissa@cse.ucdavis.edu) if you are interested in meeting the speaker. **

Abstract: I present a review on research related to the applications of big data and information technologies in urban systems. Data sources of interest include: Probe/GPS data, Credit Card Transactions, Traffic and Mobile Phone Data. Key applications are modeling adoption of new technologies and traffic performance measurements. I propose a novel individual mobility modeling framework, TimeGeo, that extracts all required features to model daily mobility from ubiquitous and sparse digital traces. Based on that framework, I present a multi-city study to unravel traffic under various conditions of demand and translate it to the travel time of the individual drivers. First, we start with the current conditions, showing that there is a characteristic time that takes to a representative group of commuters to arrive to their destinations once their maximum density has reached. While this time differs from city to city, it can be explained by the ratio of the vehicle miles traveled to their available street capacity. We identify three states of urban traffic, separated by two distinctive transitions. The first describing the appearance of the first bottle necks, and the second the transition to a complete collapse of the system. The transition to the second state measures the resilience of the various cities and is characterized by a non-equilibrium phase transition.
 
Bio: Marta C. Gonzalez is Associate Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Physics Research faculty in the Energy Technology Area (ETA) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). With the support of several companies, cities and foundations, her research team develops computer models to analyze digital traces of information mediated by devices. They process this information to manage the demand in urban infrastructures in relation to energy and mobility. Her recent research uses billions of mobile phone records to understand the appearance of traffic jams and the integration of electric vehicles into the grid, smart meter data records to compare the policy of solar energy adoption and card transactions. Credit to identify habits in spending behavior. Prior to joining Berkeley, Marta worked as an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT, a member of the Operations Research Center and the Center for Advanced Urbanism. She is a member of the scientific council of technology companies such as Gran Data, PTV and the Pecan Street Project consortium.
