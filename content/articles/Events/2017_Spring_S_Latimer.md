# If a tree falls in the forest: spatiotemporal predictions of drought induced mortality from large,
  remote sensing datasets
## Prof. Andrew Latimer

Professor Andrew Latimer in Plant Sciences will discuss his research challenges in utilizing remote
sensing datasets to understand and predict patterns of drought-induced tree mortality. For more
details see the attached flyer. A description of our unique, flipped seminar format is provided
below.


April 25 @ noon in the DSI (Shields 360)
