# Affiliates Coffee Hour

The DSI hosts weekly coffee networking hours for our graduate student and postdoctoral Affiliates. This week's special guest is [Michele Tobias](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/author/michele-tobias/), GIS Data Curator at the UC Davis Library. Michele works with researchers all over campus to develop geospatial research methods and answer questions. She received her PhD in geography from UC Davis, her Masters in ecology from University of Michigan, and her Bachelors in geography from UCLA. Her post doc in the UCD Information Center for the Environment involved exploring geospatial methods for a variety of academic disciplines. Her personal research interests include ecology of sandy beach vegetation, kite aerial photography, and image classification. She uses a variety of tools including desktop GIS (QGIS, ArcGIS, and others), R, Python, and occasionally JavaScript.

This event is open to all current  and active DSI Affiliates. To learn more and to apply to be a DSI Affiliate, see [here](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/membership.html).
