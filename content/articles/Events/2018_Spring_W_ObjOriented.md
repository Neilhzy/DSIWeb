#  Object Oriented Concepts, Flexible Functions, and Software Design in R

In this workshop led by Dr. Duncan Temple Lang, we'll discuss object-oriented programming concepts in R.  We'll cover the  the S3, S4, Reference classes and S6 mechanisms, and how they relate to the modeling software and paradigm in R.  We'll talk about how to work with and use them when developing functions and methods, and in creating or modifying R packages. This workshop will cover concepts and practices for making code extensible and customizable with classes and other idioms. 

Prerequisites: intermediate R skills and a working R environment.
