# Seminar Series - Network Theory

UC Davis is hosting an exciting series of talks and visits in association with the Network Theory HIP program. The speakers are accomplished scholars in network theory, with diverse research spanning computer science, physics, and data science. Refreshments and time for conversation will immediately follow after the talks. Please join us so that we can highlight to these accomplished individuals the vigor of interdisciplinary science activities ongoing across the UC Davis campus. Please email [Dr. Raissa D'Souza](mailto:raissa@cse.ucdavis.edu) if you would like to arrange an individual research meeting with any of the speakers.  

## Maksim Kitzak, "Latent geometry in networked systems: theory and applications"
Department of Physics & Network Science Institute, Northeastern University 
*Tues, Feb 20*, 3:10pm, 1131 Kemper Hall

Abstract: The prediction and control of the dynamics of networked systems is one of the central problems in network science. Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, though the nature and common origins of such laws remain elusive. Do these universal laws exist? We do not have the answer to this questionâ€¦ yet.
 
I will talk about the latent geometry approach to networked systems, which could be a first step toward the formulation of universal laws for network dynamics. In this approach, networks underlying complex systems are viewed as discretizations of smooth geometric spaces. Network nodes are points in these spaces and the probability of a connection between nodes is fully determined by the distance between them: the smaller the distance between the two nodes the higher the probability of a connection.
 
I will start with the general discussion of the symmetry and maximum entropy principles and will argue that applied to networks these principles imply latent geometry. I will continue with the discussion of computational algorithms for uncovering latent geometries of real networked systems. Finally, I will conclude my talk by describing existing and prospective applications of the latent geometry to the Internet interdomain routing, understanding human diseases and forecasting social dynamics.

Bio: Dr. Kitsak is an associate research scientist in the Department of Physics and the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University. Dr. Kitsak earned Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Boston University under the direction of Prof. H. E. Stanley. Dr. Kitsak held postdoctoral positions at the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA), UC San Diego and the Center for Complex Network Research (CCNR), Northeastern University. His research focuses on the development of theoretical and computational approaches to networks with applications ranging from the Internet interdomain routing to complex diseases. Results of his research were published in top cross-disciplinary journals, such as Nature, Nature Physics, Science, and Science Advances and received broad media coverage.
