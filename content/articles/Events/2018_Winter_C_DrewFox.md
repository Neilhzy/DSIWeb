# Affiliates Coffee Hour

The DSI hosts weekly coffee networking hours for our graduate student and postdoctoral Affiliates. This week's special guest is Assistant Professor of Psychology [Andrew Fox](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://foxlab.ucdavis.edu/&sa=D&ust=1516233859550000&usg=AFQjCNFPiC8tdDeF8X4sGCvX-Zlrn3M3Sw). Drew studies the neuroscience of social and emotional behavior in human and nonhuman primates. His research focuses on emotional and social decision-making and the development of social anxiety disorder. Drew uses Python in his teaching and research, and runs a new Python Users Group (PUG) at the DSI.
