# Affiliates Coffee Hour

The DSI hosts weekly coffee networking hours for our graduate student and postdoctoral Affiliates. This week's special guest is [Vessela Ensberg](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/author/vessela-ensberg/). Vessela leads the Data Management Program at UC Davis Library. The Program aims to make research data easily discoverable, accessible and understandable both among immediate collaborators and for long-term re-use. Vessela wants to see data used to their full potential, and the researchers who produced them to be recognized for their valuable work. She has experience with data both as a scientist (Ph.D. in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Wisconsin--Madison) and as a data curator at UCLA Library. In her work as a curator, she has worked with data from multiple disciplines from the sciences and social sciences. She strives to provide solutions for data organization and standardization to enable UC Davis researchers to both seamlessly collaborate on an active project and to fulfill federal and publisher requirements for sharing and archiving of data.

This event is open to all current  and active DSI Affiliates. To learn more and to apply to be a DSI Affiliate, see [here](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/membership.html).
