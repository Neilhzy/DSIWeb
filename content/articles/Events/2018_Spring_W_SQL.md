#  Using Relational Databases and SQL in R

In this workshop led by Dr. Duncan Temple Lang, we'll discuss how to use relational databases from within R, when to use them, different database models and implementations (client-server and standalone), and the database ecosystem in R and its computational model.  We'll focus on using existing databases and the basic elements of SQL and different modes of queries. Weâ€™ll also cover some of the more advanced ideas and features (e.g., R functions as user-defined functions in SQL). Based on attendee interests, this workshop may also cover the process and design of creating databases, NoSQL, distributed databases, and other related topics. 

Prerequisites: beginner R skills and a working R environment are helpful, but non-R users interested in SQL may also find this workshop helpful.
