# Affiliates Coffee Hour

The DSI hosts weekly coffee networking hours for our graduate student and postdoctoral Affiliates. This week's special guest is Associate Professor [Titus Brown](http://biosci3.ucdavis.edu/Faculty/Profile/View/14516). Titus' research group focuses on data intensive biology. His background is in developmental molecular biology, gene networks and systems biology, with a current focus on making biological sense of large amounts of sequencing data from non-model systems. Titus' group also develops software for sequence data and runs and teaches training in data-intensive biology. They also run "MAD" (Meet and Analyze Data), weekly drop-in help and work sessions at his lab on the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine campus. For more information about Titus, his lab, research, and MAD, see [here](https://github.com/ctb/resume/blob/master/WHOAMI.md) and [here](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/).

This event is open to all current  and active DSI Affiliates. To learn more and to apply to be a DSI Affiliate, see [here](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/membership.html).
