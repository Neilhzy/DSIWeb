The DSI is bringing together scholars from across disciplines at UC Davis to discuss the issues of replicable and reproducible research, including: open science, scientific integrity, transparency and openness, credibility, philosophy and ethics of science, incentive structures in science, meta-science, etc. Weâ€™ll emphasize big picture issues that cut across disciplines, rather than specific technical skills or statistical issues within a domain. No prior experience or expertise is necessary; all individuals from all domains and at all career stages (students, postdocs, faculty, staff) are welcome to attend.

Future activities on this theme may include discussions groups, workshops, and mini-conferences. If you are interested in presenting or organizing an activity, please contact contact [datascience@ucdavis.edu](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu). The group is organized by Pamela Reynolds and Duncan Temple Lang at the Data Science Initiative, and [Simine Vazire](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/people/svazire) from the Psychology Department.

*No registration is required. Please distribute broadly to any who may be interested.*
