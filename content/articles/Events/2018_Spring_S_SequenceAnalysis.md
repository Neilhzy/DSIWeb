# A Brief Introduction of Sequence Analysis
by [Tim Liao](https://sociology.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tfliao), professor for sociology and statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Description: Sequence analysis (SA) is a relatively new method that was first introduced into the social sciences three decades ago. Since then, it has seen many useful developments suitable for social scientific data analysts. SA is data intensive, with each case consisting of a sequence of many spells, each of which can exhibit one of many qualitative states. In this brief introduction, we begin by introducing some very simple sequence data, before summarizing the highlights of two papers by SA analysts, thereby showing how SA is conducted.

At Illinois, he served as Head of the Department of Sociology 2004-2009 and is Director of the Center for East Asian and Pacific Studies (on leave in 2017-2018). He was Chair of the Methodology Section, the American Sociological Association (2009-2011).
