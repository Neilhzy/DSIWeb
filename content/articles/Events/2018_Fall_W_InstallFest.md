#  InstallFest 2018

Fall 2018's kick-off event for the Data Science Initiative is a community #InstallFest. Come with your computer to this drop-in workshop to work on installing different pieces of software commonly used for research in and applying Data Science. Experts from the DSI, Library, IET, Center for Spatial Sciences, and more from across campus will be around to help you overcome install problems.

This is great opportunity to:

* meet other students and researchers with similar interests, 
* find out about  new software
* troubleshoot installs on your machine
* ask questions about how to get started with different software

Note that this event is focused on getting people over the hurdles in getting started with Data Science software. This is *NOT* intended as technical support for general computer issues or general support for a specific class and will not provided a guided overview on how to use a specific tool. Want to know more about a specific tool or technology and how to apply it to your research? Complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PJN-ifhOdUsFIX5cGl7y1pSldPsOfnT1MCO4Fat2DWA/formrestricted?edit_requested=true) or [send us an email](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu) to suggest a topic for a future workshop.
