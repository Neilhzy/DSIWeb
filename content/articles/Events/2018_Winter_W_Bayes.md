# A gentle introduction to Bayesian inference

To register, select the appropriate workshop [here](https://forms.library.ucdavis.edu/classes/descriptions.php#class174).

## Description:
DSI postdoc Matt Espe will cover the basic foundations of Bayes, and then dive into a few different tools for Bayesian inference. It will be both basic and high-level, and suited for someone with an introduction to statistics, but not a Bayesian master (i.e., more of a survey).
