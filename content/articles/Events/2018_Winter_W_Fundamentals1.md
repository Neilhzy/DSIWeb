# R Fundamentals - Part I

To register, select the appropriate workshop [here](https://forms.library.ucdavis.edu/classes/descriptions.php#class174).

## Description:
This 3-part workshop series led by DSI Director and Professor of Statistics Duncan Temple Lang explores the underlying computational model of the R language. It is strongly encouraged, although not required, that you attend all three sessions as they build upon each other. A longer version of this series was taught in the DSI as a [mini-course in summer 2017](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/posts/Workshop/RFundamental20170711.html). 

The aim of this series is to help participants understand the
relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R
language. This will help you reason about code before you write
and run it, and to debug it if it doesn't do what you want.  A sound
understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much
easier and more productive. Basically, we want you to understand how
the R interpreter works. 

## Prerequisites:
This is *not* an introduction to R. Participants are expected to have an
elementary understanding and prior experience using R, be comfortable 
with basic R syntax, and to have it pre-installed and running on their laptops. 
This series is appropriate for motivated beginners as well as intermediate 
to advanced users who want a better understanding of base R. It is open
to UC Davis faculty, graduate students, postdocs, staff, and undergraduates; 
DSI affiliates receive priority registration.

## Notes:
* Goal of this workshop series is to learn the grammar of the R language (not just the vocabulary!):
	* how R actually works
	* be able to reason about R code
	* what R does and how to do things
	* increase productivity and confidence in using R
* Content:
	* Part 1: 
		* REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
			* Read includes parsing (R assesses whether the command is grammatically correct)
			* It can be helpful to know whether an error is in the parse or eval step
		* Parsing: grammatical construction
			* If you get an error, use the parse() functionality to check
			* class() tells you what an object is
		* Evaluation, Function calls
			* everything in R is a function call
			* how do you ask if something is a function? Example: get("+") will tell you that + is a primitive
			
		
		
		
		
	* Part 2: Data types, subsetting
	* Part 3: Functions, debugging formula, S3 & S4
