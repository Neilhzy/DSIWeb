Title:  Measuring Effectiveness in Transportation

# Measuring Effectiveness in Transportation
## Deb Niemeier</h3>

The notion of measuring translation effectiveness is well embedded in the field of health
sciences. Less research has been performed on how well engineering research, both basic and applied,
has been integrated into practice. This is particularly true for transportation engineering. Within
this arena, there are multiple avenues of research including basic science (e.g., the translation of
chemical innovations into pavement design), planning (e.g., managing the relationship between land
use and transportation improvements), and design (e.g., congestion pricing or redesign of
intersections). This talk focuses on questions associated with how to assess the effectiveness of
the translation of engineering research knowledge to practice through the National Cooperative
Highway Research Program (NCHRP). The NCHRP issues well over 50 reports a year, many of them
performed by consultants, through which advances in engineering research are made available to
practitioners. I will step through the methods that I am considering for analyzing these reports and
the potential problems that arise in testing various hypotheses.
