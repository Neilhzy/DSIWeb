A reading group on emerging technologies for high-level languages. The
tentative format is to pick an academic paper, read it before hand, and then
meet for around an hour to discuss it.

Topics may include:
- compilation
- parallel processing
- code analysis / transformation
- data storage / language interfaces

Each week's reading will be announced to the DSI mailing list. Anyone
interested is welcome to join us.
