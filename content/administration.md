## Advisory Committee

* _[MacKenzie Smith](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/about/university-librarian/)_, University Librarian at UC Davis. Smith creates and leads the strategic vision for the UC Davis libraries and oversees operations for the university's four main libraries (Shields, Physical Sciences & Engineering, Carlson Health Sciences, and Blaisdell Medical). She leads the library's efforts to integrate digital resources an information technology to serve the university's academic community. She has published on information technology and digital knowledge management, and works toward creating and sustaining efforts that enhance efficient and effective access to knowledge. Smith leads the DSI advisory group.
* _[Hemant Bhargava](https://sites.google.com/site/hemantb/)_, Professor, MBSA Program Chair, Jerome and Elise Suran Chair in Technology Management. Professor Bhargava is an expert in technology management and the information technology industry. He also studies the use of IT in clinical health care, and has previously worked on data-driven and analytical decision making in organizations.
* _[Colin Cameron](http://cameron.econ.ucdavis.edu/)_, Professor of Economics. Professor Cameron’s research speciality is economic theory and microeconmetrics for cross-section data, especially count data, with applications to labor and health economic data. 
* _[John Daniels](http://socialscience.ucdavis.edu/about-iss/people/john-daniels-ssds-statistical-programming-consultant)_, Statistical Programming Consultant and Systems Administrator for the Social Science Data Service. Daniels maintains the SSDS central research systems and provides consulting for statistical and mathematical software applications used by social scientists. He has a background in political science and has worked for over 20 years in the fields of information technology and quantitative research support.
* _[Paul Dodd](http://research.ucdavis.edu/about-us/or-leadership/#avcirsi)_, Associate Vice Chancellor for Interdisciplinary Research and Strategic Initiatives. Dr. Dodd’s background is in nanoscale materials science and applied physics, and has worked at the interface of industry, academia for over 20 years. He administers the ten UC Davis Organized Research Units and is responsible for developing interdisciplinary research activities for the Davis campus including initiating, supporting and coordinating the development of new strategic research partnerships. You can read more about his background and the UC Davis interdisciplinary research and strategic initiatives, [here](http://research.ucdavis.edu/about-us/or-leadership/#avcirsi).
* _[Benjamin Houlton](https://www.bzhoulton.com/),_ Chancellor’s Fellow, Professor of Global Environmental Studies, and Director of the John Muir Institute for the Environment (JMIE). Professor Houlton’s research interests include ecosystem processes, climate change and the growing risks of human alterations to the global carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous cycles for enhanced energy and food production. As Director of JMIE, Professor Houlton catalyzes research discovery across more than 300 faculty-experts from across UC Davis to devise innovative solutions to the environmental sustainability challenges of the 21st century.
* _[Louise Kellogg](http://geology.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/kellogg.php)_, Professor of Geophysics and Director of [Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics](https://geodynamics.org/). Professor Kellogg studies the dynamics of the solid Earth and similar planets, focusing on mantle convection and crustal deformation using computational models rooted in observation. She established the [W. M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES)](http://keckcaves.org/) where her research includes interactive visualization of data from natural disaster sites, reconstructing paleoocean flow, and using virtual reality and augmented reality for research and outreach.
* _[Patrice Koehl](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/)_, Professor of Computer Science and Founding Director of the Data Science Initiative. Professor Koehl’s interests lay at the interface of physics, geometry and biology. His research focuses on computational algorithmic developments and management of complex biological data as well as the quantification of biological systems (morphometry) and the formation (morphogenesis) and evolution (morphodynamics) of of molecular shapes. His research group develops new statistical algorithms for clustering post-genomic data, and geometric methods for processing image data for high-throughput comparisons of 3D-images.
* _[Prasant Mohapatra](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/mohapatra/biography/)_, Professor of Computer Science, Dean of Graduate Studies and Vice-Provost of Graduate Education. Professor Mohapatra’s research interests focus on wireless networks, mobile communications, cybersecurity and internet protocols. Dr. Mohapatra is the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, and he has published over 300 research papers in his field.
* _[Viji Murali](https://iet.ucdavis.edu/cio)_, Chief Information Office and Vice Provost of Information and Educational Technology (IET) at UC Davis. Murali oversees IET and leads the development of a coordinated IT technology strategy across the university, including the Davis and Sacramento (Health System) campuses. With nearly three decades of experience in the field of information technology, Murali has led major initiatives in research, high-performance, instructional, administrative efficiency, and enterprise computing, as well as telecommunications. As a member of the UC Davis Health System IT Oversight Committee and the University of California IT Leadership Council, she works in partnership with the system-wide leadership to articulate goals and seek opportunities to address common IT challenges. She has a background in chemistry and a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Arizona, Tucson.
* _[Tony Tyson](http://tyson.ucdavis.edu/)_, Distinguished Professor of Physics. Professor Tyson is an experimental physicist with research in cosmology including dark matter distribution, gravitational lens effects, cosmic shear, the nature of dark energy, and instrumentation for optical astronomy. He pioneered the field of weak gravitational lensing, and dark energy was discovered using one of his wide field CCD cameras. Prior to coming to UC Davis he worked in the physics division at Bell Labs.

The DSI is supported by the Provost. Logistical support is provided by the [UC Davis Library](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/).
