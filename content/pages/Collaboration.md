Title: DSI Collaborations

# DSI Collaborations 
We are extremely keen to collaborate with researchers on campus on ambitious
projects where expertise in data science would have a significant impact on the
work. We are willing to commit human and computational resources in the next
several quarters and summer to a few challenging projects. The challenges can
include acquiring visualizing, analyzing the data, or improving the
computational efficiency of very computationally intensive methods or on very
large amounts of data.

We want these collaborations to be more than simple consulting and programming.

## Call for 1- or 2- quarter projects 
The DSI team will work with selected groups on projects that would significantly benefit from data science skills. See [here]({filename}/pdfs/DSICallForProjects-1.pdf) for more information about how to apply. We will continue to accept proposals after April 1st.


However, we are very happy to provide advice about any technical matters
related to data science. [Contact us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu), or drop by one of our [office hours]({category}services).
