* Visualization for exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Approaches to cleaning data
* Data Management and curation, Security and Privacy
* Data Analysis via Statistical and Machine learning and modeling
* Visualization and Presentation of Results (e.g., Web based visualization, dashboards)
* Computational Issues (e.g., parallel computing, algorithmic and software development)
* Making data available to others via Web APIs, or bulk-download
* Reproducibility and Provenance

## Office hours
We have office hours for advising.
See the specific [office hours]({category}services) from our team.
We are also very interested in collaborating on more significant, longer-term projects.

The [Statistics Lab](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/stat-lab/services.html) on campus also provides consulting for statistical topics.
