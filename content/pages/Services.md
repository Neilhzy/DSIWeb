# DSI Services

The Data Science Initiative provides advice and collaboration services to researchers (faculty, post-docs, graduate students, staff) on all aspects of the Data Science process. This data pipeline includes

* Accessing data (e.g., from Web pages, APIs, databases)
* Structuring data for analysis (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL, text search engines, Hive, Pig)
* Visualization for exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Approaches to cleaning data
* Data Management and curation, Security and Privacy
* Data Analysis via Statistical and Machine learning and modeling
* Visualization and Presentation of Results (e.g., Web based visualization, dashboards)
* Computational Issues (e.g., parallel computing, algorithmic and software development)
* Making data available to others via Web APIs, or bulk-download
* Reproducibility and Provenance

We have office hours for advising. We are also very interested in collaborating on more significant, longer-term projects.
The Statistics Lab on campus also provides consulting for statistical topics.
