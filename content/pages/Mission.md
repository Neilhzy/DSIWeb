# Mission of the Data Science Initiative

The primary missions of the Data Science Initiative are education and research.
Both aspects are inherently inter-disciplinary and specifically trying to go
beyond what individual departments and programs can provide.    

* Improve general basic data literacy.
* Train students at all levels in the essentials of Data Science.
* Complement the existing educational programs to provide the inter-disciplinary
education for Data Science.
* Facilitate research involving Data Science.
* Enable qualitatively new research made possible by data and Data Science,
helping researchers in different fields to identify and exploit new
opportunities.
* Foster inter-disciplinary research using Data Science as a common pillar.
