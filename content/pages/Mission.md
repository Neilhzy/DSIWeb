# Mission of the Data Science Initiative

The primary missions of the Data Science Initiative are education and research.
Both aspects are inherently inter-disciplinary and specifically trying to go
beyond what individual departments and programs can provide.    

* Improve general basic data literacy.
* Train students at all levels in the essentials of Data Science.
* Complement the existing educational programs to provide the inter-disciplinary
education for Data Science.
* Facilitate research involving Data Science.
* Enable qualitatively new research made possible by data and Data Science,
helping researchers in different fields to identify and exploit new
opportunities.

# Our plan
<p>
The Data Science Initiative hopes to serve as a hub of emerging activity
on campus related to statistical and machine  learning, technology developments,
inter-disciplinary data-related research and education.
To that end, we plan to
</p>
<ul>
<li> hold regular informal seminars to discuss new technologies and methods,
      and brainstorm about problems in different domains;
  </li>
<li> run an inter-disciplinary seminar series on cutting-edge aspects of Big Data Science;
  </li>
<li> offer practical workshops on Data Science, HPC and Big Data topics, methods and technologies;
  </li>
<li> house researchers from different disciplines in a shared space to foster interaction on new
      ideas and solutions;
  </li>
<li> with faculty from different departments, develop new courses covering data science skills,
      methods, and practice;
  </li>
<li> facilitate new programs (minors, majors, designated emphases and degrees) in Data Science
      from various different departments and graduate groups by combining courses and resources
      across the campus;
  </li>
<li> develop consulting services for the campus and opportunities for students to
       work on and help with research activities and problems on campus;
  </li>
<li> connect students with internship opportunities in industry, government labs and campus
      facilities;
  </li>
<li> assist in other campus efforts to strengthen computing infrastructure and HPC for Big Data for the campus.
</li>
</ul>
 Foster inter-disciplinary research using Data Science as a common pillar.
