[Workgroup Report]()

# Workgroup Charge
The 2013 report of the ["Big Data Implementation Committee"](http://tinyurl.com/qyhe7tj) proposed the
creation of a Data Science Institute (DSI), which is now being organized under the leadership of
Professor Duncan Temple-Lang and University Librarian MacKenzie Smith. In the process of developing
this institute, it has become apparent that due to the rapid evolution and impact of data sciences
in both research and in the classroom, it is now a good time to consider carefully whether this
field might benefit from an independent academic home at UC Davis.

In considering the possibilities, I encourage you to think futuristically about possible structures,
and to consider these issues from the perspective of research, education, faculty, graduate and
undergraduate student programs. How an academic unit could foster interdisciplinary research
services, outreach and collaboration is another consideration. A discipline that transcends many
academic boundaries, such as data sciences, should be housed in a manner that encourages
interdisciplinary approaches and minimizes boundaries as much as possible. It seems to me that the
College of Letters and Sciences, which itself spans a wide range of disciplines, would provide an
ideal home for the new unit, but I ask for your wisdom and thoughts on this possibility. Within the
college and perhaps a specific division, the unit should benefit from porous boundaries and maximal
input from all relevant constituencies across campus.
