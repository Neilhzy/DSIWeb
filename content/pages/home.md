    <h4>A hub for Data Science</h4>
    <p>
    The fledgling Data Science Initiative will help to foster, catalyze, coordinate and promote
    research and education related to Data Science and Big Data on campus.
    It aims to serve as a place for like-minded faculty, postdocs, graduate students
    and undergraduates to come together to explore a vibrant new inter-disciplinary field
    that leverages phenomenal changes in technology, computational capabilities
    and statistical and machine learning developments.

    <h4>Interdisciplinary collaborations</h4>
  	<p>
    Data Science and Big Data are more than the sum of
    statistics, machine learning and computer science.
    They are the outcome of a very recent, structural change in the nature of research in many
    disciplines, ranging from bioinformatics, astrophysics, psychology, neuro-science, political
    science, economics, business and commerce, environmental science, linguistics and
    the humanities, generally.

    <h4> Training Data Scientists </h4>
     <p> Data Scientists are in high demand, both in industry and research.  The set of skills a Data
     Scientist needs is broader than one discipline or degree program alone. This challenges the
     existing models and the Data Science Initiative plans to work with and facilitate inter-departmental
     development of new courses and degree programs at both the undegraduate and graduate levels to train
     students in Data Science.

<p>
The Data Science Initiative hopes to serve as a hub of emerging activity
on campus related to statistical and machine  learning, technology developments,
inter-disciplinary data-related research and education.
We plan to
</p>
<ul>
<li> hold regular informal seminars to discuss new technologies and methods,
      and brainstorm about problems in different domains;
  </li>
<li> run an inter-disciplinary seminar series on cutting-edge aspects of Big Data Science;
  </li>
<li> offer practical workshops on Data Science, HPC and Big Data topics, methods and technologies;
  </li>
<li> house researchers from different disciplines in a shared space to foster interaction on new
      ideas and solutions;
  </li>
<li> with faculty from different departments, develop new courses covering data science skills,
      methods, and practice;
  </li>
<li> facilitate new programs (minors, majors, designated emphases and degrees) in Data Science
      from various different departments and graduate groups by combining courses and resources
      across the campus;
  </li>
<li> develop consulting services for the campus and opportunities for students to
       work on and help with research activities and problems on campus;
  </li>
<li> connect students with internship opportunities in industry, government labs and campus
      facilities;
  </li>
<li> assist in other campus efforts to strengthen computing infrastructure and HPC for Big Data for the campus.
</li>
</ul>
