    <p>
    The fledgling Data Science Initiative will help to foster, catalyze, coordinate and promote
    research and education related to Data Science and Big Data on campus.
    It aims to serve as a place for like-minded faculty, postdocs, graduate students
    and undergraduates to come together to explore a vibrant new inter-disciplinary field
    that leverages phenomenal changes in technology, computational capabilities
    and statistical and machine learning developments.

  	<p>
    Data Science and Big Data are more than the sum of
    statistics, machine learning and computer science.
    They are the outcome of a very recent, structural change in the nature of research in many
    disciplines, ranging from bioinformatics, astrophysics, psychology, neuro-science, political
    science, economics, business and commerce, environmental science, linguistics and
    the humanities, generally. We want to promote interdisciplinary
		collaborations that use Data Science tools.

    <h4><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-education"></span> Training for Data Scientists </h4>
     <p> Data Scientists are in high demand, both in industry and research.  The set of skills a Data
     Scientist needs is broader than one discipline or degree program alone. This challenges the
     existing models and the Data Science Initiative plans to work with and facilitate inter-departmental
     development of new courses and degree programs at both the undegraduate and graduate levels to train
     students in Data Science.
