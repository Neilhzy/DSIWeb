# DSI Facilities and Space

The DSI occupies a large space on the 3rd floor of Shields Library.

The main areas include:

## DSI workspace  
We currently provide office and work space for faculty, researchers, visitors,
postdocs and graduate students who are keen to work on
inter-disciplinary projects related to Data Science.

## DSI classroom (Room 360) 
Our classroom can sit around 40 participants and we regularly hold seminars
and allow other people to use our space for Data Science events.
See [our calendar]({filename}./Calendar.md) to find out if the classroom is occupied.

## DSI conference room (Room 362)
We hold office hours in the conference room.

See the directions at this [page]({filename}./Directions.md).
