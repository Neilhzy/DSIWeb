<h1>DSI Collaborations</h1>
<p>
We are extremely keen to collaborate with researchers on campus
on ambitious projects where expertise in  data science
would have a significant impact on the work.
We are willing to commit human and computational resources
in the next several quarters and summer to a few challenging projects.
The challenges can include  acquiring 
visualizing, analyzing the data, or improving the computational efficiency
of very computationally intensive methods or on very large amounts of data.

<p>
We want these collaborations to be more than simple 
<a	href="pages/Services.html"> consulting</a> and
programming.  However, we are very happy to provide advice about
any technical matters related to data science.
Contact us, or drop by one of our office hours.
