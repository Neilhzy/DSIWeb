Title: DSI Collaborations

# DSI Collaborations 

Do you have a challenging research question or complex dataset that you think
would benefit from our data science expertise? If so, contact us at
<mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu>! We're keen to think about ambitious projects
that push the envelope - whether that's within your discipline, across
disciplines, or within the growing field of data science itself. We have human
and computational resources at the DSI to allocate to compelling research
challenges, ranging from data acquisition, visualization and analysis to
improving computational efficiency for big data and/or intensive methodology.

We are especially interested in interdisciplinary problems that involve
researchers from across UC Davis. In the true meaning of collaboration, we
expect to work with you through the entire data science pipeline. We want to
come in at the early stages of the project formation and continue to contribute
through the data interpretation and generation of final products. Our goal is 
to have a specific product outcome from each collaboration, whether that's 
generating pilot results for a grant proposal or complete results for a 
paper, developing new custom software, etc.

We will have periodic calls for proposals, which will be announced on the News
section of the DSI web page and on our mailing lists. But don't hesitate to contact 
us if you have a brilliant idea outside of the collaboration calls as we can
also take on new projects on a rolling basis.

## Current Interdisciplinary Collaborative Projects at the DSI include:

* __[Dr. Amber Boydstun](http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/boydstun/Home.html)__ (Department of Political Science): How does media
  issue framing influence public opinion? How do issue frames tend to rise,
  fall and evolve in the media over time? Do the often co-varying degree of
  public attention and prevalence of competing issue frames correlated with the
  influence of a specific media frame on public opinion? The DSI is providing
  assistance with extracting data from news articles and visualization.

* __[Dr. Ronald Fong](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/facultybio/search/faculty/1084)__ (UC Davis Medical Center): What contributes to a
  patients' expected length of stay in a hospital? The DSI is helping to
  develop dynamic, predictive models from electronic medical record data to
  augment clinician recommendations for patient treatment and discharge plans.

* __[Dr. Jacob Hibel](http://jhibel.faculty.ucdavis.edu/)__ (Department of Sociology): How do local communities
  articulate goals, priorities and action plans for their school districts to
  foster increased access to special services? The DSI is helping to develop an
  automated workflow for processing elementary and unified school district LCAP
  (Local Control and Accountabliity Plans) pdfs, and to code stated policies
  for analysis.

* __[Dr. Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/)__ (Department of Plant Biology): How are genotypes related
  to phenotypes, and vice versa? Being able to predict those relationships with
  high accuracy can improve agriculture and lead to better models of how plants
  adapt and grow. Recent advancements in genotyping and phenotyping methods
  have led to exponential increases in the volume of data from short-read
  RNA/DNA sequences to extensive measurements across thousands of individual
  plants. The DSI is helping the Maloof lab to develop a database and workflow
  pipeline to increase data transparency, accessibility and discovery for
  enhanced analytical pursuits.

* __[Dr. Pranav Pandit](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/ohi/centers/epicenter.cfm)__ (EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics, One Health Institute):
  How can we predict and preemt outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, which pass from
  animals to humans? The DSI is helping to scrape global data on emerging
  zoonotic viruses, host ranges, outbreaks and emergence mechanisms to build a
  relational database and develop models to assess the drivers of zoonotic
  emergences.  

* __[Dr. Claudia Sánchez-Gutiérrez](https://spanish.ucdavis.edu/en/people/profile/2585)__ (Department of Spanish and Portuguese):
  What specific vsual and auditory input do learners receive when learning a
  new language, and how does it relate to language acquisition? The DSI is
  helping to analyze American college Spanish language textbooks and in-class
  lecture recordings to test the role of lexical frequency on automatic word
  processing across different proficiency levels. 

* __[Dr. Mairaj Syed](https://religions.ucdavis.edu/people/profile/1359)__ (Department of Religious Studies): Authenticating hadiths
  (reports attributed to the Prophet Muhammad or his companions and other
  authorities in early Islam) is enhanced by reliable dating methods. The DSI
  is developing software to automate the task of collecting and collating
  multiple versions of the same report, as well as with web scraping and data
  integrity verification, to compare contents for dating and authentication.
