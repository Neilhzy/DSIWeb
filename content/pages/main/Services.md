# DSI Services

The Data Science Initiative provides advice and collaboration services to researchers (faculty, post-docs, graduate students, staff) on all aspects of the data science process, including:

* Obtaining and accessing data (e.g., from Web pages, APIs, databases)
* Structuring data for analysis (e.g., relational databases, NoSQL, text search engines, Hive, Pig)
* Data management, curation, security and privacy
* Approaches for cleaning data
* Data analysis via statistical and machine learning and modeling
* Visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and presentation of results (e.g., Web based visualization, dashboards)
* Computational Issues (e.g., parallel computing, algorithmic and software development)
* Data sharing and making it available to others via Web APIs, or bulk-download
* Reproducibility and provenance
* Other data science education and implementation resources at UC Davis


##Consulting
Assistance with your data science needs can be addressed through participation in DSI events, tutorials and workshops. 
We also offer drop-in [office hours]({tag}officehours), during which we will provide advice on technical matters related to data science. Check our calendar as these are subject to change, or [contact us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu) to request an alternate time to meet.

If you have general questions regarding data management plans and/or GIS, we will also refer you to the Data Management Program](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/service/data-management/) at the University Library, and for data analysis we will refer you to the list of courses at UC Davis and the [Statistics Lab](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/stat-lab/services.html) on campus.
