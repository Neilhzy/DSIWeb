From Bonnie Magnuson-Skeels, a former UC Davis student:
<p>
Data Scientist at Samba TV:
<a href="https://samba.tv/careers/?gh_jid=81416">https://samba.tv/careers/?gh_jid=81416</a>
<p>
Samba TV is a stable, profitable start-up headquartered in San Francisco. Our software performs automatic content recognition of video playing on smart TVs (for users that opt in). This allows us to do real-time, detailed analytics of what people are watching on TV, which is very interesting and valuable information for both TV networks and advertisers! The data science team is growing quickly; it's currently 7 people (6 data scientists  + 1 manager) with diverse backgrounds: physics, operations research, geography, and engineering so far. We use a lot of Python and Spark and work closely with the data engineering team to handle, analyze, and model the massive amounts of data pouring into our system. Current projects include:
<ul>
<li>  building a statistically representative panel of TVs to calculate show and commercial ratings
<li>  mapping devices within a household to measure cross-screen habits
<li>  algorithmically identifying commercial pods to build a schedule of what commercials played where and when
<li>  using our data and the benefit of hindsight to improve our content ID process
</ul>
 started in October 2016, love it so far, and would be happy to talk to anyone interested in the company/refer them into our hiring system.
