<h2>Membership</h2>
<dl>
Founded in 2014, the DSI generates and facilitates interdisciplinary research and training across the diversity of big data users and researchers across the UC Davis campus and Medical Center, including:
  <dt>

<h3>Graduate Student & Postdoctoral Affiliates</h3>
Training and incorporation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in data science is a core mission of the DSI. By drawing from students and researchers in programs from across campus, we foster intellectual exchange and interdisciplinary interactions. Engaged affiliates are eligible to apply for competitive DSI graduate student researcher positions as well as research and travel grants.

<h4>Nomination</h4>
Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by a current DSI faculty member. Nominations are considered during the annual call for membership in the fall. Students and postdocs are welcome and encouraged to attend DSI seminars, workshops and tutorials prior to applying for membership.

<h4>Participation</h4>
Expectations for affiliate participation includes attending the Problem Solving seminar series, attending DSI workshops and tutorials, participating in Affiliates research projects, contributing to challenge projects, presenting a seminar or tutorial, holding office hours, mentoring undergraduates, performing administrative duties, working in the DSI space, and other engagements with the DSI. Active affiliates are expected to be physically present in the DSI space, which features dynamic workstations, conference and study rooms. The depth and extent of participation by DSI affiliates is also an important metric for their consideration for DSI funding and awards. 

<h4>Review & Termination of Membership</h4>
Affiliates memberships in the DSI will be reviewed annually. At this time, affiliates can decide whether to renew or terminate their affiliation with the DSI. Affiliates that terminate their membership cannot apply for research and travel funds, and forfeit any unused current awards, but can re-apply for active status in the future.

<h3>Faculty Members</h3>
UC Davis faculty may join if:
<li>
<li> Their research area is either represented in, or appropriate for, research in data science.
<li>
<li> Their research benefits from application or existing or development of new data science tools.
<li>
<li> Their scientific contributions are of obvious merit and commensurate with those of current members.
<li>
<li> They have contributed to or can be expected to contribute to research, teaching, and activities of the DSI.

<h4>Nomination</h4>
Candidates for membership must be brought to the attention of the DSI director. Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by a current DSI faculty member. Nominations are accepted year round.

<h4>Expectations</h4>
Faculty members are expected to support the mission and goals of the DSI by:
<li>
<li> Engaging in DSI events.
<li>
<li> Attending, developing, leading and/or otherwise supporting DSI workshops and tutorials.
<li>
<li> Attending DSI seminars.
<li>
<li> Presenting a Problem Solving un-seminar other other talk. Faculty are expected to give a talk within their first year of membership, but can designate a student or research associate to present for their group in subsequent years. 
<li>
<li> Other contributions to the Data Science community at UC Davis.

<h4>Review & Termination of Membership</h4>
DSI faculty membership will be reviewed every 3 years, at which time faculty can decide whether they seek to renew or terminate their membership. We view turnover and admittance of new members as a healthy mechanism by which to meet the growing and evolving data science needs of the UC Davis community and to accomodate changes in faculty research needs and career timing. 


<h3>Professional Research Associates/h3>
We encourage participation in the DSI by Project Scientists, Research Specialists, Academic Coordinators, and other non-faculty professionals. These individuals are often in the trenches and at the forefront of data science and provide continuity for ongoing research projects. Nominations and expectations for associates are similar to those for faculty members.
