# Mission of the Data Science Initiative


Advances in technology and the ever-growing role of digital sensors and computers have led to an exponential growth in the amount and complexity of data. Big data and its applications are becoming more available and add value to tackling theoretical and applied research questions from health to humanities, engineering to the environment. This proposes both a challenge and an opportunity to combine and leverage existing knowledge to tackle complex problems, to develop new tools to do so more effectively, and to teach their implementation. The Data Science Initiative (DSI) is a cross-university activity at UC Davis that seeks to address these challenges by fostering, promoting and facilitating data science to accelerate discovery at the frontiers of scientific, engineering and social disciplines. Our vision of data science includes engineering, reproducibility and provenance in addition to computing, statistics, visualization, software development and domain knowledge. By combining techniques across disciplines, we problem solve to further both data science application and theory, and engage in all activities involved in working with data (i.e., identifying, acquiring/accessing, transforming, exploring, visualizing, modeling, and summarizing data). 

Our primary goals are to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Make qualitatively new research possible
</li>
<li> Accelerate data-driven exploration, and
</li>
<li> Train researchers throughout their career to be skilled at working with data at all stages of the analysis pipeline. 


To that end, the DSI complements existing and developing educational programs to facilitate research in data science and provide a niche for students, faculty and professional researchers seeking to move beyond their individual programs to identify and exploit new opportunities. Our core values are excellence in learning, discovery and engagement to promote curiosity and innovation in the development and application of data science.


# Our plan
<p>
The Data Science Initiative is a hub of emerging activity on campus related to statistical and machine learning, technology developments, interdisciplinary data-related research and education. Specifically, we:
<ul>
<li> Hold informal seminars to discuss new technologies and methods, and brainstorm about problems in different domains.
</li>
<li> Run interdisciplinary seminar series on cutting-edge aspects of Data Science.
</li>
<li> Offer practical workshops on Data Science, HPC and Big Data topics, methods and technologies.
</li>
<li> House researchers from different disciplines in a shared space to foster interactions, ideas and solutions.
</li>
<li> Foster interdisciplinary research using Data Science as a common pillar.
</li>
<li> Work with faculty from different departments and develop new courses covering data science skills, methods, and practice.
</li>
<li> Facilitate new programs (minors, majors, designated emphases, degrees) in Data Science and link courses and resources across campus.
</li>
<li> Develop consulting services for the campus and provide opportunities for students to work on and help with cutting-edge research.
</li>
<li> Connect students with internship opportunities in industry, government labs and campus facilities.
</li>
</ul> Assist in other campus efforts to strengthen computing infrastructure for UC Davis and the UC system.
