# About the Data Science Initiative
Advances in technology and the ever-growing role of digital sensors and
computers have led to an exponential growth in the amount and complexity of
data. We are at a threshold of an era in which hypothesis-driven science is
being complemented with data-driven discovery. The data collected are complex
in size, dimension and heterogeneity and provide unprecedented opportunities
for new discoveries in theoretical and applied research. The Data Science
Initiative (DSI) at UC Davis leverages existing knowledge to tackle complex
problems, develops new tools to do so more effectively, and teaches their
implementation and development. As a cross-university activity, the DSI
fosters, promotes and facilitates data science to acceleratediscovery at the
frontiers of scientific, engineering and social disciplines. The DSI partners
with researchers across UC Davis to push the envelope both within and across
disciplines to perform qualitatively novel, interdisciplinary research. 

# The mission of the DSI is to:

* Promote academic and research excellence through quality programs, engaged
  researchers, and an innovative research and learning environment.
* Meet growing industry and academic need for graduates with data science
  skills.

Our core values are excellence in learning, discovery and engagement to promote
curiosity and innovation in the development and application of data science.
The DSI's vision of data science includes engineering, reproducibility and
provenance in addition to computing, statistics, visualization, software
development and domain knowledge. By combining techniques across disciplines,
we problem solve to further both data science application and theory, and
engage in all activities involved in working with data (i.e., identifying,
acquiring/accessing, transforming, exploring, visualizing, modeling, and
summarizing data). 

# The primary goals of the DSI are to:
* make qualitatively new research possible, 
* accelerate data-driven exploration, and 
* train researchers throughout their career to be skilled at working with data
  at all stages of the analysis pipeline. 

To that end, the DSI complements existing and developing educational programs
to facilitate research in data science and provide a niche for students,
faculty and professional researchers seeking to move beyond their individual
programs to identify and exploit new opportunities.

The DSI is a bottom-up organization adapting to UC Davis' needs and
opportunities, rising to fill identified gaps and support institutional
excellence. As a hub of emerging activity on campus related to statistical and
machine learning, technology developments, and interdisciplinary data-related
research and education, we:

* Hold informal seminars to discuss new technologies and methods, and
  brainstorm about problems in different domains.
* Run interdisciplinary seminar series on cutting-edge aspects of data
  science.
* Offer practical workshops on data science, HPC and Big Data topics, methods
  and technologies.
* House researchers from different disciplines in a shared space to foster
  interactions, ideas and solutions.
* Foster interdisciplinary research using data science as a common pillar.
* Work with faculty from different departments and develop new courses covering
  data science skills, methods, and practice.
* Facilitate new programs (minors, majors, designated emphases, degrees) in
  data science and link courses and resources across campus.
* Connect students with internship opportunities.
* Assist in other campus efforts to strengthen computing infrastructure for UC
  Davis and the UC system.
