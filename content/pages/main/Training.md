# Education & Training
We aim to help meet the growing industry and academic need for graduates with data science skills by training researchers throughout their career to be skilled at working with data at all stages of the analysis pipeline. 
To that end, we offer workshops (short seminars, half to full day, or multiple day modules) that complement the material taught in regular courses, provide hands-on applications, and present new topics and under development techniques. 
Workshop topics depend on the needs of our data science community and available expertise. 


# Workshop Schedules:

SPRING 2017: Fridays 12-1:30pm @ DSI, Shields Library room 360

*April 14: Part I - Overview of Python for Data Analysis (Clark Fitzgerald and Nick Ulle)
This first of a two-part workshop will provide a high level overview of popular Python packages for scientific computing followed by hands on activities using these tools to perform an end-to-end data analysis task.
Prerequisites: Come to the workshop with Python, panda, and bokeh installed and running on your laptop. We use and recommend the Anaconda distribution, found here: https://www.continumm.io/downloads. https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=sxcUKfZSbb4

*April 21: Part II - Overview of Python for Data Analysis (Clark Fitzgerald and Nick Ulle)
This second of a two-part workshop will continue the hand on activities using popular Python packages to perform an end-to-end data analysis task. Prerequisites: Attend the first session (April 14th).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBUlTESUQE8

*April 28: Efficient code in R (Duncan Temple Lang)
It is relatively easy to write R code quickly, but harder to write quick R code. We'll discuss some general strategies for writing faster R code and then explore R tools for finding bottlenecks in code and how to make these faster. We'll use one or two in-depth case studies to see the process and reasoning you would use on code. We'll also look at alternative approaches to making code faster by integrating other languages, e.g., the shell, SQL and databases, and C and C++. The intent is to show that these are quite accessible. Prerequisites: This is an intermediate/advanced workshop and attendees are expected to have a working knowledge of R. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJUUevlzoj0

*May 5: Part I - Lessons from Binary Classification: Overfitting and surrogate losses (James Sharpnack)
Binary classification is the canonical machine learning task and its study has a rich history.  Much of the main principles of machine learning have been discovered in this context.  These principles continue to guide the broader development of machine learning, and they motivate methods such as cross-validation, kernel support vector machines, logistic regression, and neural networks.  We will highlight the resultant methods and will accompany this with data driven examples. To best prepare for the workshop, bring a laptop pre-loaded with jupyter, python, numpy and scikit-learn (they can be installed through anaconda, https://anaconda.org/anaconda). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHbze3AYG8I.

*May 12: Part II - Lessons from Binary Classification: Non-parametric methods and the kernel trick (James Sharpnack)
In this second session, we will continue to explore machine learning with data driven examples. Prerequisites: Attend the first session (May 5). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T64qdgdGRmw.

*May 26: Docker from 0 to 40 (Titus Brown)
In this workshop we’ll explore Docker, a software container platform. We'll work through some hands-on Docker exercises, and then talk about some of the use cases and challenges around Docker-based practice (including some discussion of Singularity, and a set of pointers to further reading on workflow uses and communities of practice like Dockstore and Biocontainers). Prerequisites: Attendees should be comfortable with the command line. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cE6d34kf8

*June 2: Data Visualization Principles (Duncan Temple Lang)
In this workshop, we'll discuss best practices for displaying different types of static data. This is about designing data visualizations rather than the software and instructions we use to actually render them. We'll cover some basic principles to keep in mind, explore different types of plots, critique some good and bad examples of displaying data and how to think about creating effective plots.
