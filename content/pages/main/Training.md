# Education & Training
We are very interested in teaching topics in data science.
We want to complement the material taught in regular courses,
 presenting either new topics not addressed in courses or in a more "applied"/consumer-oriented
manner that does not require taking an entire course for a quarter.
We are keen to run 

*   1 or 2 day workshops,
*   week-long bootcamps,
*   mini-courses/modules (e.g., 4 week long classes that meet for 3 hours per week)

We also plan to introduce new data science courses.

# Suggest a workshop
We have posted possible
topics and you can indicate in which topics you are interested via that form.

First, <a href="https://cas.ucdavis.edu/cas/login?service=https%3a%2f%2fshibboleth.ucdavis.edu%2fidp%2fAuthn%2fRemoteUser"> sign into </a> your UC Davis email account, then you can propose <a
href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/forms/d/1PJN-ifhOdUsFIX5cGl7y1pSldPsOfnT1MCO4Fat2DWA/viewform?usp=send_form"> topics </a> for workshops.

We also strongly encourage you to suggest other topics via the same form.
The best way to get a workshop is to suggest a topic and get other people on campus to also suggest
it so that we know there is sufficient genuine interest.
You can also <a href="mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu">mail us</a> to suggest a topic.
