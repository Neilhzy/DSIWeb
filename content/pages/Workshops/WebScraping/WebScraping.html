<p>
There are now so many Web-based sources of data for researchers in almost all fields.
In addition to the vast amount of, e.g., biological, climate, cosmological and traffic data,
we can digitally access census data, political information, images, ancient texts
and, of course, live content and network data from social media such as Twitter and Facebook.
Being able to efficiently access this data is a powerful new skill and tool for all researchers.
It is a skill that can open up new aspects of research and make new things possible.
</p>

<p> We will run a one-day workshop on accessing data from Web pages and Web services/APIs.  The
workshop is aimed at graduate students and postdocs and we strongly encourage interested students
from the humanities and social sciences to attend.  One of the goals of the workshop is to help
researchers access the vast amount of data that is increasingly available from Web pages and
structured programming interfaces (APIs).  
</p>

<p>
The topics we will cover include
<ul>
  <li> Extracting data from HTML pages.
  <li> HTML forms.
  <li> XML, XPath and JSON
  <li> The important aspects of HTTP.
  <li> Web Services and REST
  <li> Authentication - passwords, OAuth, OAuth2.
</ul>
At the end of the workshop, you will have learned about the core Web technologies
and how to programmatically access data via the Web using these technologies
from within a commonly used, interactive programming language.
</p>

<p>
We will use R and/or Python as the language(s) for examples. You should have basic familiarity with
using either of these, i.e., be able to call a function, load a package/module, assign a variable.
However, the workshop will focus on the important and general concepts of Web
scraping and services/APIs rather than on these languages.
</p>


<p>
Register for the workshop by
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/forms/d/11QFus5L1VRjZg1EF1JUccWZ9c8GtNL2PKc3KcZbBB6M/viewform?usp=send_form">completing this form</a>.
</p>

<p>
We will determine the best day to hold the workshop after people have registered.
Space is limited, so please only register if you will attend the entire day, i.e., whichever days
you indicate you can attend.
Please register as soon as possible so we can finalize the day.
</p>


<p>
The instructors will be <a href="mailto:dtemplelang@ucdavis.edu">Duncan Temple Lang</a> and Patrice Koehl.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will be a mix of instruction/lectures and hands-on, guided practicals.
We expect you to bring a laptop to be able to follow along and work on the sample problems.
