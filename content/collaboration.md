Title: DSI Collaborations

# DSI Collaborations 

Do you have a challenging research question or complex dataset that you think
would benefit from our data science expertise? If so, contact us at
<mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu>! We're keen to think about ambitious projects
that push the envelope - whether that's within your discipline, across
disciplines, or within the growing field of data science itself. We have human
and computational resources at the DSI to allocate to compelling research
challenges, ranging from data acquisition, visualization and analysis to
improving computational efficiency for big data and/or intensive methodology.

We are especially interested in interdisciplinary problems that involve
researchers from across UC Davis. In the true meaning of collaboration, we
expect to work with you through the entire data science pipeline. We want to
come in at the early stages of the project formation and continue to contribute
through the data interpretation and generation of final products. Our goal is 
to have a specific product outcome from each collaboration, whether that's 
generating pilot results for a grant proposal or complete results for a 
paper, developing new custom software, etc.

## Call for Projects

We have periodic calls for proposals, which will be posted on our [Announcements](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/category/recent.html) page
and on our [mailing list](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/signup.html). Our most recent call can be found [here](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu/category/recent/CallForProjects.html). But, don't hesitate to contact us if you have a brilliant idea outside of the collaboration call periods.


## Current Interdisciplinary Collaborative Projects:

* __Data Bodies at Play__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Gina Bloom](https://modlab.ucdavis.edu/), Department of English, [ModLab](http://modlab.ucdavis.edu/)
  <br/>
  How do our relationships with technology influence how we learn and interact? 
  How do gamers voices and bodies adapt to a challenging interface? By using 
  gamer performances of Play the Knave (http://playtheknave.org), a digital game created at UC Davis by 
  [ModLab](http://modlab.ucdavis.edu/) where players digitally enact scenes from Shakespeare's plays, the DSI is using 
  machine learning to explore how players respond when faced with the "glitch" of challenging 
  Shakespearian language and/or the visual interface.
   
* __Media Issue Framing__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Amber Boydstun](http://psfaculty.ucdavis.edu/boydstun/Home.html), Department of Political Science
  <br/>
  How does media issue framing influence public opinion? How do issue frames tend to rise,
  fall and evolve in the media over time? Do the often co-varying degree of
  public attention and prevalence of competing issue frames correlated with the
  influence of a specific media frame on public opinion? The DSI is providing
  assistance with data exploration and visualization.

* __Predicting Length of Hospital Stays__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Ronald Fong](http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/facultybio/search/faculty/1084), UC Davis Medical Center 
  <br/>
	One of the most significant problems in emergency medical care across the country is predicting how long a patient will remain hospitalized. We are attempting to build a better predictive model by taking into account both quantitative and qualitative data from electronic medical records, with the goal to assist clinician recommendations for patient treatment and discharge planning. 

* __Learning from LCAPS__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Jacob Hibel](http://jhibel.faculty.ucdavis.edu/), Department of Sociology 
  <br/>
  How do local communities articulate goals, priorities and action plans for their school districts to
  foster increased access to special services? The DSI is helping to develop an
  automated workflow for extracting data from complex-structured school district LCAP
  (Local Control and Accountabliity Plans) PDF documents, and to code stated policies
  for analysis.

* __Seismic Curation, Rescue & Archival Project__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Lorraine Hwang](http://geodynamics.org/), Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics
  
* __Predicting Zoonotic Diseases__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Christine Kreuder Johnson](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/results.cfm?fid=17867), EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics, One Health Institute
   <br/>
	How can we predict and preempt outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, which pass from
  animals to humans? The DSI is helping to extract data on emerging
  zoonotic viruses, host ranges, outbreaks and emergence mechanisms to build a
  database and develop models to assess the drivers of zoonotic emergences.
  
  * __Creativeness Digital Scholarship Group__
    <br/>
	[Dr. David Kyle](http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/djkyle), Department of English
   <br/>
	From the Civil War to World War II, diverse intellectual and institutional voices debated the nature and role of 
  human creative power or "creativeness." A noun coined only in the 1920s, "creativity" was shaped by grafting 
  scientific management onto the creative imagination of the 1950s, when social scientists and government agents 
  began advancing the concept and developing research advocating or a more institutionalized version believed 
  necessary for Cold War-era bureaucracies. Using computational methods, we are analyzing tens of thousands of 
  newspaper documents produced from 1950-1970 to identify key actors, institutions revealing how 
  "creativeness" evolved into modern "creativity." The DSI is assisting with improving the optical character recognition
  (OCR) and programmatically reading and reassembling the articles, which span different columns across multiple pages. 
  
  * __Genotype-Phenotype Database Design__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/), Department of Plant Biology 
   <br/>
	How are genotypes related to phenotypes, and vice versa? Being able to predict those relationships with
  high accuracy can improve agriculture and lead to better models of how plants
  adapt and grow. Recent advancements in genotyping and phenotyping methods
  have led to exponential increases in the volume of data from short-read
  RNA/DNA sequences to extensive measurements across thousands of individual
  plants. The DSI is helping the Maloof lab to develop a database and workflow
  pipeline to increase data transparency, accessibility and discovery for
  enhanced analytical pursuits.
 
* __L2 Spanish Learners__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Claudia Sánchez-Gutiérrez](https://spanish.ucdavis.edu/people/claudia-sanchez-gutierrez), Department of Spanish and Portuguese
  <br/>
  What specific vsual and auditory input do learners receive when learning a
  new language, and how does it relate to language acquisition? The DSI is
  helping to analyze American college Spanish language textbooks and in-class
  lecture recordings to test the role of lexical frequency on automatic word
  processing across different proficiency levels. 

* __Hiring in Academia__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Kimberlee Shauman](http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/kashauma), Department of Sociology
  <br/>
  What features drive hiring biases in academia? Is it discipline specific, driven by a lack of diverse candidate pools, or 
  are there other implicit bias in the hiring process? To tackle this issue we are data mining faculty application packages. 
  The DSI is helping to extract relevant information from applicant PDFs that feature semi-structured text (CVs, letters of recommendation, 
  transcripts) for evaluation of applicant academic history, research, output, collaborations, and evaluations against current hiring trends. 

  * __Authenticating Hadiths__
    <br/>
	[Dr. Mairaj Syed](https://religions.ucdavis.edu/people/profile/1359), Department of Religious Studies 
  <br/>
   Hadiths are reports attributed to the Prophet Muhammad or his students and other
  authorities in early Islam.  There is a wealth of information within the collection of hadiths
  ranging from their dates and locations to the social network between the teachers and students. 
  A large-scale analysis of these allows a qualitatively new approach and understanding.
  The DSI is developing software to automate the task of collecting and collating
  these hadiths and the different books in which they located. 

* __Naturally Labeled__
  <br/>
  [Dr. Charlotte Biltekoff](http://www.charlottebiltekoff.com/), Department of American Studies and Food Science & Technology
  <br/>
	What are the cultural politics of dietary health and the values and beliefs that shape American eating habits? Ther e is often a disconnect between the legal meaning of words as defined by the Food and Drug Administration and their use by labelers and understanding by consumers. We are using various modes of scraping and text mining (sentiment analysis, source tracking, topic modeling) of online public comments to [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm456090.htm) proposals and decisions to better understand the complex personal, corporate, official, and legal discourses surrounding the labeling of food.

## Grants:

* __Data Science for the Built Environment, [NSF NRT-IGE Grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1545193)__
  <br/>
   Debbie Niemeier, Annamaria Amenta, Jonathan Eisen, Duncan Temple Lang, Megan Welsh 
  <br/>
  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate
  Education (IGE) Track to the University of California-Davis will pilot, test, and compare modes of
  datascience instruction. The testbed project will provide critical new information to inform the
  development of new learning platforms designed to cultivate robust computational, statistical, and
  data reasoning skills in engineering graduate students.
  <br/>
    The project will implement a hybrid short-course approach that 1) bridges existing code camps and
  semester long classes, and 2) is coupled with a formal user group experience. A robust evaluation
  will be conducted to identify the individual effects of code camps, short courses, and users groups,
  as well as the effect of participating in combinations of experiences. In addition, learning gains,
  self-efficacy to engage in interdisciplinary studies that require data science principles, and
  career trajectories (including decisions to take additional coursework in data science and decisions
  to pursue interdisciplinary research and employment involving data science) will be examined. The
  project will generate new knowledge that addresses a particularly important gap in knowledge in
  terms of whether intense short-term learning experiences result in longer-term retention of skill
  development and computational reasoning. Findings on effectiveness of different modes of data
  science instruction in engineering will be broadly applicable to all data-enabled science and
  engineering fields.
