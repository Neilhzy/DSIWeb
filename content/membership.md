Title: DSI Membership
Author: DSI UC Davis

# Membership

Founded in 2014, the DSI generates and facilitates interdisciplinary research
and training across the diversity of big data users and researchers across the
UC Davis campus and Medical Center, including:

### Graduate Student & Postdoctoral Affiliates

Training and incorporation of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in
data science is a core mission of the DSI. By drawing from students and
researchers in programs from across campus, we foster intellectual exchange and
interdisciplinary interactions. Active affiliates have access to our resources
(space, computers, community, etc.) and will be eligible to apply for
competitive travel grants, GSR positions, and other opportunities through the
DSI.

#### Nomination

Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by a current DSI faculty member.
Nominations are considered during the annual call for membership in the fall.
Students and postdocs are welcome and encouraged to attend DSI seminars,
workshops and tutorials prior to applying for membership. The affiliate
application can be accessed here: <https://goo.gl/forms/MsmJgA3dpwlcSXFi1>.

#### Participation

We expect all affiliates to be actively engaged in some aspects of the DSI.
You'll get to learn and share new things, get ideas for your research, develop
new projects, find new information, and network among yourselves and others.
This interdisciplinary interaction is so valuable, rare and requires taking the
time to participate. 

1. Attend (and present) at our Problem Solving un-Seminars. You don't have to
   know anything about the talk topic to contribute and learn from these unique
   'flipped' design talks. We expect all affiliates to present a problem
   solving un-seminar during their tenure in our program. Contact us if you
   have a topic in mind and we'll discuss and get you on the schedule. Also, we
   appreciate your help in identifying individuals across the university who
   would also be good candidates as speakers for this series. 
2. Participate in our workshops. Come learn a new skill or, if you are already
   proficient in that topic, come as a workshop TA. Have expertise in an area
   and want to give a workshop? Have suggestions for future workshops? Let us
   know! 
3. Hold group office hours at the DSI. Get together with other affiliates who
   have complementary technical skills and strengths and pick a consistent time
   to be available throughout the quarter to field questions from the research
   community on campus. This is great experience if you are considering a
   career in industry and/or consulting, looks good on your CV, and is good
   practice for you to apply the skills you have learned to a variety of
   projects. We will put out a call for affiliate times and topics each
   quarter.
4. Organize or participate in a reading group. These can be a short format (a
   few weeks) or a longer (quarter or year long) self-taught investigation into
   any topic within the broad purview of data science. To gauge interest and
   form a group on a topic, send an email out to your peers on the
   <mailto:disaffiliates@ucdavis.edu> listserv describing the topic. Once you
   have a group together let us know when you want to meet and we'll get you
   the space. 
5. Lead or participate in an affiliates project If you have an interesting
   research question or side project, form a working group with your colleagues
   here at the DSI. The project can relate to your individual research, a
   competition or just something you find interesting and want to investigate -
   it's up to you to decide what you want to do. We already have a few
   successful examples of these projects ongoing at the DSI and want to foster
   more. Not sure how to set up and manage a research team? Pamela can help you
   get started. 6. Mentor data science undergrads We have a few undergrad
   interns here at the DSI and a new data science club is forming on campus.
   Contact Pamela if you're interested in becoming a mentor for individual
   students and/or the club. This is a minimal-time investment activity that
   can have a big impact on the lives of our students. 
7. "Be" in the DSI space. Come to the DSI and spend some time working and
   interacting with your peers from across the university. We have designated
   workspaces at the DSI for our affiliates, which are assigned based on need
   and availability, and first-come-first-serve workspaces for drop-in or more
   occasional use.
8. Help with admin activities for the DSI. This includes assisting with ongoing
   activities as well as planning and seeking out new opportunities for the DSI
   to engage in meaningful ways with campus and the broader community. 
9. We welcome suggestions for other creative ways that affiliates can be active
   in our data science community. Send an email to
   <mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu> or come talk with us. 

#### Review & Termination of Membership

Affiliates memberships in the DSI will be reviewed annually. At this time,
affiliates can decide whether to renew or terminate their affiliation with the
DSI. Terminated affiliates will be removed from the affiliates listserv and
cannot apply for research and travel funds, and forfeit any unused current
awards.

### Faculty Members
UC Davis faculty may join if:

* Their research area is either represented in, or appropriate for, research in
  data science.
* Their research benefits from application or existing or
  development of new data science tools.
* Their scientific contributions are of obvious merit and commensurate with
  those of current members.
* They have contributed to or can be expected to
  contribute to research, training, and other strategic activities of the DSI.

#### Nomination

Candidates for membership must be brought to the attention of the DSI Director.
Candidates may self-nominate or be nominated by a current DSI faculty member.
Nominations are accepted year round. To apply, [contact us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu) for the (brief) application link.

### Professional Research Associates

We encourage participation in the DSI by Project Scientists, Research
Specialists, Academic Coordinators, and other non-faculty professionals. These
individuals are often in the trenches and at the forefront of data science and
provide continuity for ongoing research projects. Contact
<mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu> for more information.
