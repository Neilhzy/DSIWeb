# Education & Training

The DSI offers workshops (short seminars, half to full day, or multiple day
modules) that complement the material taught in regular courses, provide
hands-on applications, and present new topics and under development techniques.
Workshop topics depend on the needs of our data science community and available
expertise. Workshops are announced here and on our [listserv](signup.html).
