Title: Workshops & Training

# Education & Training
We aim to help meet the growing industry and academic need for graduates with
data science skills by training researchers throughout their career to be
skilled at working with data at all stages of the analysis pipeline. To that
end, we offer workshops (short seminars, half to full day, or multiple day
modules) that complement the material taught in regular courses, provide
hands-on applications, and present new topics and under development techniques.
Workshop topics depend on the needs of our data science community and available
expertise. 

# Workshop Schedule

#### Spring 2017

Fridays 12-1:30pm @ DSI Classroom (Shields Library 360)

*   April 14: __Overview of Python for Data Analysis, Part I__ (Clark
    Fitzgerald)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=sxcUKfZSbb4))

    This first of a two-part workshop will provide a high level overview of
    popular Python packages for scientific computing followed by hands on
    activities using these tools to perform an end-to-end data analysis task.

    _Prerequisites: Come to the workshop with Python, pandas, and bokeh
    installed and running on your laptop. We recommend [Anaconda][]._

*   April 21: __Overview of Python for Data Analysis, Part II__ (Nick Ulle)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBUlTESUQE8))
    

    This second of a two-part workshop will continue the hand on
    activities using popular Python packages to perform an end-to-end data
    analysis task.

    _Prerequisites: Attend the first session (April 14th)._

*   April 28: __Efficient code in R__ (Duncan Temple Lang)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJUUevlzoj0))
 
    It is relatively easy to write R code quickly, but harder to write quick R
    code. We'll discuss some general strategies for writing faster R code and
    then explore R tools for finding bottlenecks in code and how to make these
    faster. We'll use one or two in-depth case studies to see the process and
    reasoning you would use on code. We'll also look at alternative approaches
    to making code faster by integrating other languages, e.g., the shell, SQL
    and databases, and C and C++. The intent is to show that these are quite
    accessible.

    _Prerequisites: This is an intermediate/advanced workshop and attendees are
    expected to have a working knowledge of R._

*   May 5: __Lessons from Binary Classification, Part I: Overfitting and
    Surrogate Losses__ (James Sharpnack)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHbze3AYG8I))

    Binary classification is the canonical machine learning task and its study
    has a rich history.  Much of the main principles of machine learning have
    been discovered in this context.  These principles continue to guide the
    broader development of machine learning, and they motivate methods such as
    cross-validation, kernel support vector machines, logistic regression, and
    neural networks.  We will highlight the resultant methods and will
    accompany this with data driven examples.
    
    _Prerequisites: Bring a laptop pre-loaded with Jupyter, Python, NumPy and
    Scikit-Learn (they can be installed through [Anaconda][])._

*   May 12: __Lessons from Binary Classification, Part II: Non-parametric
    Methods and the Kernel Trick__ (James Sharpnack)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T64qdgdGRmw))

    In this second session, we will continue to explore machine learning with
    data driven examples.

    _Prerequisites: Attend the first session (May 5)._

*   May 26: __Docker from 0 to 40__ (Titus Brown)
    ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1cE6d34kf8))

    In this workshop we'll explore Docker, a software container platform.
    We'll work through some hands-on Docker exercises, and then talk about some
    of the use cases and challenges around Docker-based practice (including
    some discussion of Singularity, and a set of pointers to further reading on
    workflow uses and communities of practice like Dockstore and
    Biocontainers).
    
    _Prerequisites: Attendees should be comfortable with the command line._

*   June 2: __Data Visualization Principles__ (Duncan Temple Lang)

    In this workshop, we'll discuss best practices for displaying different
    types of static data. This is about designing data visualizations rather
    than the software and instructions we use to actually render them. We'll
    cover some basic principles to keep in mind, explore different types of
    plots, critique some good and bad examples of displaying data and how to
    think about creating effective plots.
