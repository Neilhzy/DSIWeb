# Languages
There are many programming languages used in Data Science. They all have important, but quite different, roles, and have various
advantages and disadvantages. For our research and training workshops at the DSI we primarily use:

### Primary languages we use at the DSI include:
[R](http://www.r-project.org)
[Python](http://www.python.org)
[Julia](http://julialang.org)
[C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/)

### Other languages courses and research groups use on campus:
[MatLab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
[C++](https://isocpp.org/)
[Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org)
[SAS](http://www.sas.com)
[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html): Primarily used in visualization, dashboards, and mashups for webpages.
[Fortran](http://www.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/)
[SQL](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/downloads/index.html)
