    The Data Science Initiative focuses on making qualitatively new research
    possible, accelerating data-driven exploration, and training researchers
    throughout their career to be skilled at working with data at all stages of
    the analysis pipeline. Is provides a place for like-minded faculty, postdocs and
    graduate and undergraduate students to come together to explore a vibrant
    new inter-disciplinary field that leverages phenomenal changes in
    technology, computational capabilities and statistical and machine learning
    developments.

    Data Science is more than the sum of statistics, mathematics, machine
    learning and computer science. It is the outcome of a recent, structural
    change in the nature of research in many disciplines, ranging from
    bioinformatics, astrophysics, psychology, neuro-science, political science,
    economics, business and commerce, environmental science, linguistics and
    the humanities, and more. We promote interdisciplinary collaborations using
    data science tools.

     Data Scientists are in high demand, both in industry and research.  The
     set of skills a Data Scientist needs is broader than one discipline or
     degree program alone. The DSI works with and facilitates
     inter-departmental development of new courses and degree programs at both
     the undegraduate and graduate levels to train students in data science.
	 DSI offers regular workshops and tutorials, reading groups, and drop-in
	 office hours.
