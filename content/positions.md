*   __Data Scientist at Samba TV__
    ([link](https://samba.tv/careers/?gh_jid=81416))
    (_from Bonnie Magnuson-Skeels, a former UC Davis student_)

    Samba TV is a stable, profitable start-up headquartered in San Francisco.
    Our software performs automatic content recognition of video playing on
    smart TVs (for users that opt in). This allows us to do real-time, detailed
    analytics of what people are watching on TV, which is very interesting and
    valuable information for both TV networks and advertisers! The data science
    team is growing quickly; it's currently 7 people (6 data scientists + 1
    manager) with diverse backgrounds: physics, operations research, geography,
    and engineering so far. We use a lot of Python and Spark and work closely
    with the data engineering team to handle, analyze, and model the massive
    amounts of data pouring into our system. Current projects include:

    + building a statistically representative panel of TVs to calculate show and
      commercial ratings
    + mapping devices within a household to measure cross-screen habits
    + algorithmically identifying commercial pods to build a schedule of what
      commercials played where and when
    + using our data and the benefit of hindsight to improve our content ID process

    Bonnie writes, "I started in October 2016, love it so far, and would be
    happy to talk to anyone interested in the company/refer them into our
    hiring system."
