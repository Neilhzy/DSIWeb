Title: Call for Collaborative Projects

# Call for Collaborative Projects

One of the goals of the DSI is to provide the cutting-edge expertise 
in data science that makes qualitatively new research possible in different domains.
We are very keen to collaborate with projects from all disciplines.
This ranges from enabling new data-driven projects in traditionally non-data-driven
fields to projects that require research-level innovations in data science itself.
Ideally, projects will  have tangible outcomes in 
the form of papers, grant proposals, important insights,
but we are very open to more nascient, speculative projects.
[Contact us](mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu) to propose a collaborative project.
