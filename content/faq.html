    <h1>Data Science Initiative FAQ</h1>

    <div class="jumbotron">
        <h3> What is Data Science?</h3>
        <p style='font-size: 15px'> There are many definitions. But the broad, common answer is all of the
            activities involved in working with data: identifying, acquiring and
            accessing, transforming and manipulating, exploring, visualizing, modeling,
            summarizing data and making inferences from the data and making decisions
            based on these. It also involves data engineering, reproducibility,
            provenance and data governance and ethics. The entire process typically involves computing, statistics,
            visualization and domain knowledge.

        <h3> What is the DSI?</h3>
        <p style='font-size: 15px'> The Data Science Initiative (DSI) is a campus-wide activity that aims to
            foster, promote and facilitate "data science" and "big data" across
            all disciplines in both research and education. The goal is to help
            make qualitatively new research possible, accelerate data-driven exploration,
            and help train a new type of researcher that is skilled in working
            with data at all stages of the analysis pipeline.

        <h3> Does the DSI help graduate students with their research? </h3>
	<p style='font-size: 15px'>
            Certainly. We have a core
            service of advisors/consultants that can help with accessing, managing,
            analyzing and visualizing data. We want to make new things possible
            in different fields, and facilitate people getting started working
            with data and technologies.
	    We have office hours held by the directors and DSI affiliates.
            And we encourage people to email <a href="mailto:datascience@ucdavis.edu">us</a>
            to find out when we are available and schedule an appointment.
