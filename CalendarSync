The issue is that we have different calendars that are for specific rooms
and we want to combine some of the events from  at least two of them.
We want to have the metadata of the events on
 Front page of the Web site in the ticker
 Upcoming Events Page
 Previous Events

 Central DSI calendar  (which also announces other events that we know of but are not running)
 Both calendars


We want to avoid duplicating the data in multiple places.
We want to ensure that we use the Google Calendar Web page to reserve the location
 to ensure we don't introduce a conflict by overlooking an existing reservation "programatically"


My initial suggestion is the follows

Add the metadata to the events.rss file.
  title, description and id
Use a unique id.
Reserve the space in the Google Calendar
Add the unique id as the name of the event or in the description. (We'll decide which one.)

Then a script will 
 read the calendar
 update the RSS entry with the location and time.
 add the event to the central DSI calendar
 update the Events.html and index.html file
 Schedule an update after the event is over to 
     move the event to the Previous Events
     remove it from the Upcoming events
     regenerate the index.html to remove it.
